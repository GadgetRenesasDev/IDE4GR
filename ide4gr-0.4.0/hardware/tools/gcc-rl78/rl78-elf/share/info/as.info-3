9.38.1 Options
--------------

`-isa=sh4 | sh4a'
     Specify the sh4 or sh4a instruction set.

`-isa=dsp'
     Enable sh-dsp insns, and disable sh3e / sh4 insns.

`-isa=fp'
     Enable sh2e, sh3e, sh4, and sh4a insn sets.

`-isa=all'
     Enable sh1, sh2, sh2e, sh3, sh3e, sh4, sh4a, and sh-dsp insn sets.

`-isa=shmedia | -isa=shcompact'
     Specify the default instruction set.  `SHmedia' specifies the
     32-bit opcodes, and `SHcompact' specifies the 16-bit opcodes
     compatible with previous SH families.  The default depends on the
     ABI selected; the default for the 64-bit ABI is SHmedia, and the
     default for the 32-bit ABI is SHcompact.  If neither the ABI nor
     the ISA is specified, the default is 32-bit SHcompact.

     Note that the `.mode' pseudo-op is not permitted if the ISA is not
     specified on the command line.

`-abi=32 | -abi=64'
     Specify the default ABI.  If the ISA is specified and the ABI is
     not, the default ABI depends on the ISA, with SHmedia defaulting
     to 64-bit and SHcompact defaulting to 32-bit.

     Note that the `.abi' pseudo-op is not permitted if the ABI is not
     specified on the command line.  When the ABI is specified on the
     command line, any `.abi' pseudo-ops in the source must match it.

`-shcompact-const-crange'
     Emit code-range descriptors for constants in SHcompact code
     sections.

`-no-mix'
     Disallow SHmedia code in the same section as constants and
     SHcompact code.

`-no-expand'
     Do not expand MOVI, PT, PTA or PTB instructions.

`-expand-pt32'
     With -abi=64, expand PT, PTA and PTB instructions to 32 bits only.

`-h-tick-hex'
     Support H'00 style hex constants in addition to 0x00 style.

9.38.2.1 Special Characters
...........................

`!' is the line comment character.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   You can use `;' instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

9.38.2.2 Register Names
.......................

You can use the predefined symbols `r0' through `r63' to refer to the
SH64 general registers, `cr0' through `cr63' for control registers,
`tr0' through `tr7' for target address registers, `fr0' through `fr63'
for single-precision floating point registers, `dr0' through `dr62'
(even numbered registers only) for double-precision floating point
registers, `fv0' through `fv60' (multiples of four only) for
single-precision floating point vectors, `fp0' through `fp62' (even
numbered registers only) for single-precision floating point pairs,
`mtrx0' through `mtrx48' (multiples of 16 only) for 4x4 matrices of
single-precision floating point registers, `pc' for the program
counter, and `fpscr' for the floating point status and control register.

   You can also refer to the control registers by the mnemonics `sr',
`ssr', `pssr', `intevt', `expevt', `pexpevt', `tra', `spc', `pspc',
`resvec', `vbr', `tea', `dcr', `kcr0', `kcr1', `ctc', and `usr'.


File: as.info,  Node: SH64-Addressing,  Prev: SH64-Regs,  Up: SH64 Syntax

9.38.2.3 Addressing Modes
.........................

SH64 operands consist of either a register or immediate value.  The
immediate value can be a constant or label reference (or portion of a
label reference), as in this example:

     	movi	4,r2
     	pt	function, tr4
     	movi	(function >> 16) & 65535,r0
     	shori	function & 65535, r0
     	ld.l	r0,4,r0

   Instruction label references can reference labels in either SHmedia
or SHcompact.  To differentiate between the two, labels in SHmedia
sections will always have the least significant bit set (i.e. they will
be odd), which SHcompact labels will have the least significant bit
reset (i.e. they will be even).  If you need to reference the actual
address of a label, you can use the `datalabel' modifier, as in this
example:

     	.long	function
     	.long	datalabel function

   In that example, the first longword may or may not have the least
significant bit set depending on whether the label is an SHmedia label
or an SHcompact label.  The second longword will be the actual address
of the label, regardless of what type of label it is.

9.38.3 SH64 Machine Directives
------------------------------

In addition to the SH directives, the SH64 provides the following
directives:

`.mode [shmedia|shcompact]'
`.isa [shmedia|shcompact]'
     Specify the ISA for the following instructions (the two directives
     are equivalent).  Note that programs such as `objdump' rely on
     symbolic labels to determine when such mode switches occur (by
     checking the least significant bit of the label's address), so
     such mode/isa changes should always be followed by a label (in
     practice, this is true anyway).  Note that you cannot use these
     directives if you didn't specify an ISA on the command line.

`.abi [32|64]'
     Specify the ABI for the following instructions.  Note that you
     cannot use this directive unless you specified an ABI on the
     command line, and the ABIs specified must match.

9.38.4 Opcodes
--------------

For detailed information on the SH64 machine instruction set, see
`SuperH 64 bit RISC Series Architecture Manual' (SuperH, Inc.).

   `as' implements all the standard SH64 opcodes.  In addition, the
following pseudo-opcodes may be expanded into one or more alternate
opcodes:

`movi'
     If the value doesn't fit into a standard `movi' opcode, `as' will
     replace the `movi' with a sequence of `movi' and `shori' opcodes.

`pt'
     This expands to a sequence of `movi' and `shori' opcode, followed
     by a `ptrel' opcode, or to a `pta' or `ptb' opcode, depending on
     the label referenced.

9.39.1 Options
--------------

The SPARC chip family includes several successive versions, using the
same core instruction set, but including a few additional instructions
at each version.  There are exceptions to this however.  For details on
what instructions each variant supports, please see the chip's
architecture reference manual.

   By default, `as' assumes the core instruction set (SPARC v6), but
"bumps" the architecture level as needed: it switches to successively
higher architectures as it encounters instructions that only exist in
the higher levels.

   If not configured for SPARC v9 (`sparc64-*-*') GAS will not bump
past sparclite by default, an option must be passed to enable the v9
instructions.

   GAS treats sparclite as being compatible with v8, unless an
architecture is explicitly requested.  SPARC v9 is always incompatible
with sparclite.

`-Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Asparclet | -Asparclite'
`-Av8plus | -Av8plusa | -Av8plusb | -Av8plusc | -Av8plusd | -Av8plusv'
`-Av9 | -Av9a | -Av9b | -Av9c | -Av9d | -Av9v'
`-Asparc | -Asparcvis | -Asparcvis2 | -Asparcfmaf | -Asparcima'
`-Asparcvis3 | -Asparcvis3r'
     Use one of the `-A' options to select one of the SPARC
     architectures explicitly.  If you select an architecture
     explicitly, `as' reports a fatal error if it encounters an
     instruction or feature requiring an incompatible or higher level.

     `-Av8plus', `-Av8plusa', `-Av8plusb', `-Av8plusc', `-Av8plusd',
     and `-Av8plusv' select a 32 bit environment.

     `-Av9', `-Av9a', `-Av9b', `-Av9c', `-Av9d', and `-Av9v' select a
     64 bit environment and are not available unless GAS is explicitly
     configured with 64 bit environment support.

     `-Av8plusa' and `-Av9a' enable the SPARC V9 instruction set with
     UltraSPARC VIS 1.0 extensions.

     `-Av8plusb' and `-Av9b' enable the UltraSPARC VIS 2.0 instructions,
     as well as the instructions enabled by `-Av8plusa' and `-Av9a'.

     `-Av8plusc' and `-Av9c' enable the UltraSPARC Niagara instructions,
     as well as the instructions enabled by `-Av8plusb' and `-Av9b'.

     `-Av8plusd' and `-Av9d' enable the floating point fused
     multiply-add, VIS 3.0, and HPC extension instructions, as well as
     the instructions enabled by `-Av8plusc' and `-Av9c'.

     `-Av8plusv' and `-Av9v' enable the 'random', transactional memory,
     floating point unfused multiply-add, integer multiply-add, and
     cache sparing store instructions, as well as the instructions
     enabled by `-Av8plusd' and `-Av9d'.

     `-Asparc' specifies a v9 environment.  It is equivalent to `-Av9'
     if the word size is 64-bit, and `-Av8plus' otherwise.

     `-Asparcvis' specifies a v9a environment.  It is equivalent to
     `-Av9a' if the word size is 64-bit, and `-Av8plusa' otherwise.

     `-Asparcvis2' specifies a v9b environment.  It is equivalent to
     `-Av9b' if the word size is 64-bit, and `-Av8plusb' otherwise.

     `-Asparcfmaf' specifies a v9b environment with the floating point
     fused multiply-add instructions enabled.

     `-Asparcima' specifies a v9b environment with the integer
     multiply-add instructions enabled.

     `-Asparcvis3' specifies a v9b environment with the VIS 3.0, HPC ,
     and floating point fused multiply-add instructions enabled.

     `-Asparcvis3r' specifies a v9b environment with the VIS 3.0, HPC,
     transactional memory, random, and floating point unfused
     multiply-add instructions enabled.

`-xarch=v8plus | -xarch=v8plusa | -xarch=v8plusb | -xarch=v8plusc'
`-xarch=v8plusd | -xarch=v8plusv | -xarch=v9 | -xarch=v9a'
`-xarch=v9b | -xarch=v9c | -xarch=v9d | -xarch=v9v'
`-xarch=sparc | -xarch=sparcvis | -xarch=sparcvis2'
`-xarch=sparcfmaf | -xarch=sparcima | -xarch=sparcvis3'
`-xarch=sparcvis3r'
     For compatibility with the SunOS v9 assembler.  These options are
     equivalent to -Av8plus, -Av8plusa, -Av8plusb, -Av8plusc, -Av8plusd,
     -Av8plusv, -Av9, -Av9a, -Av9b, -Av9c, -Av9d, -Av9v, -Asparc,
     -Asparcvis, -Asparcvis2, -Asparcfmaf, -Asparcima, -Asparcvis3, and
     -Asparcvis3r, respectively.

`-bump'
     Warn whenever it is necessary to switch to another level.  If an
     architecture level is explicitly requested, GAS will not issue
     warnings until that level is reached, and will then bump the level
     as required (except between incompatible levels).

`-32 | -64'
     Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.  These options
     are only available with the ELF object file format, and require
     that the necessary BFD support has been included.

9.39.2 Enforcing aligned data
-----------------------------

SPARC GAS normally permits data to be misaligned.  For example, it
permits the `.long' pseudo-op to be used on a byte boundary.  However,
the native SunOS assemblers issue an error when they see misaligned
data.

   You can use the `--enforce-aligned-data' option to make SPARC GAS
also issue an error about misaligned data, just as the SunOS assemblers
do.

   The `--enforce-aligned-data' option is not the default because gcc
issues misaligned data pseudo-ops when it initializes certain packed
data structures (structures defined using the `packed' attribute).  You
may have to assemble with GAS in order to initialize packed data
structures in your own code.

9.39.3 Sparc Syntax
-------------------

The assembler syntax closely follows The Sparc Architecture Manual,
versions 8 and 9, as well as most extensions defined by Sun for their
UltraSPARC and Niagara line of processors.

comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole

9.39.3.2 Register Names
.......................

The Sparc integer register file is broken down into global, outgoing,
local, and incoming.

   * The 8 global registers are referred to as `%gN'.

   * The 8 outgoing registers are referred to as `%oN'.

   * The 8 local registers are referred to as `%lN'.

   * The 8 incoming registers are referred to as `%iN'.

   * The frame pointer register `%i6' can be referenced using the alias
     `%fp'.

   * The stack pointer register `%o6' can be referenced using the alias
     `%sp'.

   Floating point registers are simply referred to as `%fN'.  When
assembling for pre-V9, only 32 floating point registers are available.
For V9 and later there are 64, but there are restrictions when
referencing the upper 32 registers.  They can only be accessed as
double or quad, and thus only even or quad numbered accesses are
allowed.  For example, `%f34' is a legal floating point register, but
`%f35' is not.

   Certain V9 instructions allow access to ancillary state registers.
Most simply they can be referred to as `%asrN' where N can be from 16
to 31.  However, there are some aliases defined to reference ASR
registers defined for various UltraSPARC processors:

   * The tick compare register is referred to as `%tick_cmpr'.

   * The system tick register is referred to as `%stick'.  An alias,
     `%sys_tick', exists but is deprecated and should not be used by
     new software.

   * The system tick compare register is referred to as `%stick_cmpr'.
     An alias, `%sys_tick_cmpr', exists but is deprecated and should
     not be used by new software.

   * The software interrupt register is referred to as `%softint'.

   * The set software interrupt register is referred to as
     `%set_softint'.  The mnemonic `%softint_set' is provided as an
     alias.

   * The clear software interrupt register is referred to as
     `%clear_softint'.  The mnemonic `%softint_clear' is provided as an
     alias.

   * The performance instrumentation counters register is referred to as
     `%pic'.

   * The performance control register is referred to as `%pcr'.

   * The graphics status register is referred to as `%gsr'.

   * The V9 dispatch control register is referred to as `%dcr'.

   Various V9 branch and conditional move instructions allow
specification of which set of integer condition codes to test.  These
are referred to as `%xcc' and `%icc'.

   In V9, there are 4 sets of floating point condition codes which are
referred to as `%fccN'.

   Several special privileged and non-privileged registers exist:

   * The V9 address space identifier register is referred to as `%asi'.

   * The V9 restorable windows register is referred to as `%canrestore'.

   * The V9 savable windows register is referred to as `%cansave'.

   * The V9 clean windows register is referred to as `%cleanwin'.

   * The floating-point queue register is referred to as `%fq'.

   * The V8 co-processor queue register is referred to as `%cq'.

   * The floating point status register is referred to as `%fsr'.

   * The other windows register is referred to as `%otherwin'.

   * The V9 program counter register is referred to as `%pc'.

   * The V9 trap state is referred to as `%tstate'.

   * The V9 trap type is referred to as `%tt'.

   * The V9 condition codes is referred to as `%ccr'.

   * The V9 floating-point registers state is referred to as `%fprs'.

   * The V9 version register is referred to as `%ver'.

   * The V9 window state register is referred to as `%wstate'.

   * The Y register is referred to as `%y'.

   * The V8 window invalid mask register is referred to as `%wim'.

   * The V8 processor state register is referred to as `%psr'.

   * The V9 global register level register is referred to as `%gl'.

   Several special register names exist for hypervisor mode code:

   * The hyperprivileged processor state register is referred to as
     `%hpstate'.

   * The hyperprivileged trap state register is referred to as
     `%htstate'.

   * The hyperprivileged interrupt pending register is referred to as
     `%hintp'.

   * The hyperprivileged trap base address register is referred to as
     `%htba'.

   * The hyperprivileged implementation version register is referred to
     as `%hver'.

   * The hyperprivileged system tick compare register is referred to as

9.39.3.3 Constants
..................

Several Sparc instructions take an immediate operand field for which
mnemonic names exist.  Two such examples are `membar' and `prefetch'.
Another example are the set of V9 memory access instruction that allow
specification of an address space identifier.

   The `membar' instruction specifies a memory barrier that is the
defined by the operand which is a bitmask.  The supported mask
mnemonics are:

   * `#Sync' requests that all operations (including nonmemory
     reference operations) appearing prior to the `membar' must have
     been performed and the effects of any exceptions become visible
     before any instructions after the `membar' may be initiated.  This
     corresponds to `membar' cmask field bit 2.

   * `#MemIssue' requests that all memory reference operations
     appearing prior to the `membar' must have been performed before
     any memory operation after the `membar' may be initiated.  This
     corresponds to `membar' cmask field bit 1.

   * `#Lookaside' requests that a store appearing prior to the `membar'
     must complete before any load following the `membar' referencing
     the same address can be initiated.  This corresponds to `membar'
     cmask field bit 0.

   * `#StoreStore' defines that the effects of all stores appearing
     prior to the `membar' instruction must be visible to all
     processors before the effect of any stores following the `membar'.
     Equivalent to the deprecated `stbar' instruction.  This
     corresponds to `membar' mmask field bit 3.

   * `#LoadStore' defines all loads appearing prior to the `membar'
     instruction must have been performed before the effect of any
     stores following the `membar' is visible to any other processor.
     This corresponds to `membar' mmask field bit 2.

   * `#StoreLoad' defines that the effects of all stores appearing
     prior to the `membar' instruction must be visible to all
     processors before loads following the `membar' may be performed.
     This corresponds to `membar' mmask field bit 1.

   * `#LoadLoad' defines that all loads appearing prior to the `membar'
     instruction must have been performed before any loads following
     the `membar' may be performed.  This corresponds to `membar' mmask
     field bit 0.


   These values can be ored together, for example:

     membar #Sync
     membar #StoreLoad | #LoadLoad
     membar #StoreLoad | #StoreStore

   The `prefetch' and `prefetcha' instructions take a prefetch function
code.  The following prefetch function code constant mnemonics are
available:

   * `#n_reads' requests a prefetch for several reads, and corresponds
     to a prefetch function code of 0.

     `#one_read' requests a prefetch for one read, and corresponds to a
     prefetch function code of 1.

     `#n_writes' requests a prefetch for several writes (and possibly
     reads), and corresponds to a prefetch function code of 2.

     `#one_write' requests a prefetch for one write, and corresponds to
     a prefetch function code of 3.

     `#page' requests a prefetch page, and corresponds to a prefetch
     function code of 4.

     `#invalidate' requests a prefetch invalidate, and corresponds to a
     prefetch function code of 16.

     `#unified' requests a prefetch to the nearest unified cache, and
     corresponds to a prefetch function code of 17.

     `#n_reads_strong' requests a strong prefetch for several reads,
     and corresponds to a prefetch function code of 20.

     `#one_read_strong' requests a strong prefetch for one read, and
     corresponds to a prefetch function code of 21.

     `#n_writes_strong' requests a strong prefetch for several writes,
     and corresponds to a prefetch function code of 22.

     `#one_write_strong' requests a strong prefetch for one write, and
     corresponds to a prefetch function code of 23.

     Onle one prefetch code may be specified.  Here are some examples:

          prefetch  [%l0 + %l2], #one_read
          prefetch  [%g2 + 8], #n_writes
          prefetcha [%g1] 0x8, #unified
          prefetcha [%o0 + 0x10] %asi, #n_reads

     The actual behavior of a given prefetch function code is processor
     specific.  If a processor does not implement a given prefetch
     function code, it will treat the prefetch instruction as a nop.

     For instructions that accept an immediate address space identifier,
     `as' provides many mnemonics corresponding to V9 defined as well
     as UltraSPARC and Niagara extended values.  For example, `#ASI_P'
     and `#ASI_BLK_INIT_QUAD_LDD_AIUS'.  See the V9 and processor
     specific manuals for details.

9.39.3.4 Relocations
....................

ELF relocations are available as defined in the 32-bit and 64-bit Sparc
ELF specifications.

   `R_SPARC_HI22' is obtained using `%hi' and `R_SPARC_LO10' is
obtained using `%lo'.  Likewise `R_SPARC_HIX22' is obtained from `%hix'
and `R_SPARC_LOX10' is obtained using `%lox'.  For example:

     sethi %hi(symbol), %g1
     or    %g1, %lo(symbol), %g1

     sethi %hix(symbol), %g1
     xor   %g1, %lox(symbol), %g1

   These "high" mnemonics extract bits 31:10 of their operand, and the
"low" mnemonics extract bits 9:0 of their operand.

   V9 code model relocations can be requested as follows:

   * `R_SPARC_HH22' is requested using `%hh'.  It can also be generated
     using `%uhi'.

   * `R_SPARC_HM10' is requested using `%hm'.  It can also be generated
     using `%ulo'.

   * `R_SPARC_LM22' is requested using `%lm'.

   * `R_SPARC_H44' is requested using `%h44'.

   * `R_SPARC_M44' is requested using `%m44'.

   * `R_SPARC_L44' is requested using `%l44' or `%l34'.

   * `R_SPARC_H34' is requested using `%h34'.

   The `%l34' generates a `R_SPARC_L44' relocation because it
calculates the necessary value, and therefore no explicit `R_SPARC_L34'
relocation needed to be created for this purpose.

   The `%h34' and `%l34' relocations are used for the abs34 code model.
Here is an example abs34 address generation sequence:

     sethi %h34(symbol), %g1
     sllx  %g1, 2, %g1
     or    %g1, %l34(symbol), %g1

   The PC relative relocation `R_SPARC_PC22' can be obtained by
enclosing an operand inside of `%pc22'.  Likewise, the `R_SPARC_PC10'
relocation can be obtained using `%pc10'.  These are mostly used when
assembling PIC code.  For example, the standard PIC sequence on Sparc
to get the base of the global offset table, PC relative, into a
register, can be performed as:

     sethi %pc22(_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_-4), %l7
     add   %l7, %pc10(_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+4), %l7

   Several relocations exist to allow the link editor to potentially
optimize GOT data references.  The `R_SPARC_GOTDATA_OP_HIX22'
relocation can obtained by enclosing an operand inside of
`%gdop_hix22'.  The `R_SPARC_GOTDATA_OP_LOX10' relocation can obtained
by enclosing an operand inside of `%gdop_lox10'.  Likewise,
`R_SPARC_GOTDATA_OP' can be obtained by enclosing an operand inside of
`%gdop'.  For example, assuming the GOT base is in register `%l7':

     sethi %gdop_hix22(symbol), %l1
     xor   %l1, %gdop_lox10(symbol), %l1
     ld    [%l7 + %l1], %l2, %gdop(symbol)

   There are many relocations that can be requested for access to
thread local storage variables.  All of the Sparc TLS mnemonics are
supported:

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_GD_HI22' is requested using `%tgd_hi22'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_GD_LO10' is requested using `%tgd_lo10'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_GD_ADD' is requested using `%tgd_add'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_GD_CALL' is requested using `%tgd_call'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDM_HI22' is requested using `%tldm_hi22'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDM_LO10' is requested using `%tldm_lo10'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDM_ADD' is requested using `%tldm_add'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDM_CALL' is requested using `%tldm_call'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDO_HIX22' is requested using `%tldo_hix22'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDO_LOX10' is requested using `%tldo_lox10'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDO_ADD' is requested using `%tldo_add'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_IE_HI22' is requested using `%tie_hi22'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_IE_LO10' is requested using `%tie_lo10'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_IE_LD' is requested using `%tie_ld'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_IE_LDX' is requested using `%tie_ldx'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_IE_ADD' is requested using `%tie_add'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LE_HIX22' is requested using `%tle_hix22'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LE_LOX10' is requested using `%tle_lox10'.

   Here are some example TLS model sequences.

   First, General Dynamic:

     sethi  %tgd_hi22(symbol), %l1
     add    %l1, %tgd_lo10(symbol), %l1
     add    %l7, %l1, %o0, %tgd_add(symbol)
     call   __tls_get_addr, %tgd_call(symbol)
     nop

   Local Dynamic:

     sethi  %tldm_hi22(symbol), %l1
     add    %l1, %tldm_lo10(symbol), %l1
     add    %l7, %l1, %o0, %tldm_add(symbol)
     call   __tls_get_addr, %tldm_call(symbol)
     nop

     sethi  %tldo_hix22(symbol), %l1
     xor    %l1, %tldo_lox10(symbol), %l1
     add    %o0, %l1, %l1, %tldo_add(symbol)

   Initial Exec:

     sethi  %tie_hi22(symbol), %l1
     add    %l1, %tie_lo10(symbol), %l1
     ld     [%l7 + %l1], %o0, %tie_ld(symbol)
     add    %g7, %o0, %o0, %tie_add(symbol)

     sethi  %tie_hi22(symbol), %l1
     add    %l1, %tie_lo10(symbol), %l1
     ldx    [%l7 + %l1], %o0, %tie_ldx(symbol)
     add    %g7, %o0, %o0, %tie_add(symbol)

   And finally, Local Exec:

     sethi  %tle_hix22(symbol), %l1
     add    %l1, %tle_lox10(symbol), %l1
     add    %g7, %l1, %l1

   When assembling for 64-bit, and a secondary constant addend is
specified in an address expression that would normally generate an
`R_SPARC_LO10' relocation, the assembler will emit an `R_SPARC_OLO10'
instead.

9.39.3.5 Size Translations
..........................

Often it is desirable to write code in an operand size agnostic manner.
`as' provides support for this via operand size opcode translations.
Translations are supported for loads, stores, shifts, compare-and-swap
atomics, and the `clr' synthetic instruction.

   If generating 32-bit code, `as' will generate the 32-bit opcode.
Whereas if 64-bit code is being generated, the 64-bit opcode will be
emitted.  For example `ldn' will be transformed into `ld' for 32-bit
code and `ldx' for 64-bit code.

   Here is an example meant to demonstrate all the supported opcode
translations:

     ldn   [%o0], %o1
     ldna  [%o0] %asi, %o2
     stn   %o1, [%o0]
     stna  %o2, [%o0] %asi
     slln  %o3, 3, %o3
     srln  %o4, 8, %o4
     sran  %o5, 12, %o5
     casn  [%o0], %o1, %o2
     casna [%o0] %asi, %o1, %o2
     clrn  %g1

   In 32-bit mode `as' will emit:

     ld   [%o0], %o1
     lda  [%o0] %asi, %o2
     st   %o1, [%o0]
     sta  %o2, [%o0] %asi
     sll  %o3, 3, %o3
     srl  %o4, 8, %o4
     sra  %o5, 12, %o5
     cas  [%o0], %o1, %o2
     casa [%o0] %asi, %o1, %o2
     clr  %g1

   And in 64-bit mode `as' will emit:

     ldx   [%o0], %o1
     ldxa  [%o0] %asi, %o2
     stx   %o1, [%o0]
     stxa  %o2, [%o0] %asi
     sllx  %o3, 3, %o3
     srlx  %o4, 8, %o4
     srax  %o5, 12, %o5
     casx  [%o0], %o1, %o2
     casxa [%o0] %asi, %o1, %o2
     clrx  %g1

   Finally, the `.nword' translating directive is supported as well.
It is documented in the section on Sparc machine directives.

9.39.4 Floating Point
---------------------

The Sparc uses IEEE floating-point numbers.


File: as.info,  Node: Sparc-Directives,  Prev: Sparc-Float,  Up: Sparc-Dependent

9.39.5 Sparc Machine Directives
-------------------------------

The Sparc version of `as' supports the following additional machine
directives:

`.align'
     This must be followed by the desired alignment in bytes.

`.common'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.comm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.half'
     This is functionally identical to `.short'.

`.nword'
     On the Sparc, the `.nword' directive produces native word sized
     value, ie. if assembling with -32 it is equivalent to `.word', if
     assembling with -64 it is equivalent to `.xword'.

`.proc'
     This directive is ignored.  Any text following it on the same line
     is also ignored.

`.register'
     This directive declares use of a global application or system
     register.  It must be followed by a register name %g2, %g3, %g6 or
     %g7, comma and the symbol name for that register.  If symbol name
     is `#scratch', it is a scratch register, if it is `#ignore', it
     just suppresses any errors about using undeclared global register,
     but does not emit any information about it into the object file.
     This can be useful e.g. if you save the register before use and
     restore it after.

`.reserve'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.lcomm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.seg'
     This must be followed by `"text"', `"data"', or `"data1"'.  It
     behaves like `.text', `.data', or `.data 1'.

`.skip'
     This is functionally identical to the `.space' directive.

`.word'
     On the Sparc, the `.word' directive produces 32 bit values,
     instead of the 16 bit values it produces on many other machines.

`.xword'
     On the Sparc V9 processor, the `.xword' directive produces 64 bit
     values.

9.40.1 Options
--------------

The TMS320C54X version of `as' has a few machine-dependent options.

   You can use the `-mfar-mode' option to enable extended addressing
mode.  All addresses will be assumed to be > 16 bits, and the
appropriate relocation types will be used.  This option is equivalent
to using the `.far_mode' directive in the assembly code.  If you do not
use the `-mfar-mode' option, all references will be assumed to be 16
bits.  This option may be abbreviated to `-mf'.

   You can use the `-mcpu' option to specify a particular CPU.  This
option is equivalent to using the `.version' directive in the assembly
code.  For recognized CPU codes, see *Note `.version':
TIC54X-Directives.  The default CPU version is `542'.

   You can use the `-merrors-to-file' option to redirect error output
to a file (this provided for those deficient environments which don't
provide adequate output redirection).  This option may be abbreviated to
`-me'.

9.40.2 Blocking
---------------

A blocked section or memory block is guaranteed not to cross the
blocking boundary (usually a page, or 128 words) if it is smaller than
the blocking size, or to start on a page boundary if it is larger than
the blocking size.

9.40.3 Environment Settings
---------------------------

`C54XDSP_DIR' and `A_DIR' are semicolon-separated paths which are added
to the list of directories normally searched for source and include
files.  `C54XDSP_DIR' will override `A_DIR'.

9.40.4 Constants Syntax
-----------------------

The TIC54X version of `as' allows the following additional constant
formats, using a suffix to indicate the radix:

     Binary                  `000000B, 011000b'
     Octal                   `10Q, 224q'
     Hexadecimal             `45h, 0FH'

9.40.5 String Substitution
--------------------------

A subset of allowable symbols (which we'll call subsyms) may be assigned
arbitrary string values.  This is roughly equivalent to C preprocessor
#define macros.  When `as' encounters one of these symbols, the symbol
is replaced in the input stream by its string value.  Subsym names
*must* begin with a letter.

   Subsyms may be defined using the `.asg' and `.eval' directives
(*Note `.asg': TIC54X-Directives, *Note `.eval': TIC54X-Directives.

   Expansion is recursive until a previously encountered symbol is
seen, at which point substitution stops.

   In this example, x is replaced with SYM2; SYM2 is replaced with
SYM1, and SYM1 is replaced with x.  At this point, x has already been
encountered and the substitution stops.

      .asg   "x",SYM1
      .asg   "SYM1",SYM2
      .asg   "SYM2",x
      add    x,a             ; final code assembled is "add  x, a"

   Macro parameters are converted to subsyms; a side effect of this is
the normal `as' '\ARG' dereferencing syntax is unnecessary.  Subsyms
defined within a macro will have global scope, unless the `.var'
directive is used to identify the subsym as a local macro variable
*note `.var': TIC54X-Directives.

   Substitution may be forced in situations where replacement might be
ambiguous by placing colons on either side of the subsym.  The following
code:

      .eval  "10",x
     LAB:X:  add     #x, a

   When assembled becomes:

     LAB10  add     #10, a

   Smaller parts of the string assigned to a subsym may be accessed with
the following syntax:

``:SYMBOL(CHAR_INDEX):''
     Evaluates to a single-character string, the character at
     CHAR_INDEX.

``:SYMBOL(START,LENGTH):''
     Evaluates to a substring of SYMBOL beginning at START with length
     LENGTH.

9.40.6 Local Labels
-------------------

Local labels may be defined in two ways:

   * $N, where N is a decimal number between 0 and 9

   * LABEL?, where LABEL is any legal symbol name.

   Local labels thus defined may be redefined or automatically
generated.  The scope of a local label is based on when it may be
undefined or reset.  This happens when one of the following situations
is encountered:

   * .newblock directive *note `.newblock': TIC54X-Directives.

   * The current section is changed (.sect, .text, or .data)

   * Entering or leaving an included file

   * The macro scope where the label was defined is exited

9.40.9 Directives
-----------------

`.align [SIZE]'
`.even'
     Align the section program counter on the next boundary, based on
     SIZE.  SIZE may be any power of 2.  `.even' is equivalent to
     `.align' with a SIZE of 2.
    `1'
          Align SPC to word boundary

    `2'
          Align SPC to longword boundary (same as .even)

    `128'
          Align SPC to page boundary

`.asg STRING, NAME'
     Assign NAME the string STRING.  String replacement is performed on
     STRING before assignment.

`.eval STRING, NAME'
     Evaluate the contents of string STRING and assign the result as a
     string to the subsym NAME.  String replacement is performed on
     STRING before assignment.

`.bss SYMBOL, SIZE [, [BLOCKING_FLAG] [,ALIGNMENT_FLAG]]'
     Reserve space for SYMBOL in the .bss section.  SIZE is in words.
     If present, BLOCKING_FLAG indicates the allocated space should be
     aligned on a page boundary if it would otherwise cross a page
     boundary.  If present, ALIGNMENT_FLAG causes the assembler to
     allocate SIZE on a long word boundary.

`.byte VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ubyte VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.char VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uchar VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more bytes into consecutive words of the current
     section.  The upper 8 bits of each word is zero-filled.  If a
     label is used, it points to the word allocated for the first byte
     encountered.

`.clink ["SECTION_NAME"]'
     Set STYP_CLINK flag for this section, which indicates to the
     linker that if no symbols from this section are referenced, the
     section should not be included in the link.  If SECTION_NAME is
     omitted, the current section is used.

`.c_mode'
     TBD.

`.copy "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
`.include "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
     Read source statements from FILENAME.  The normal include search
     path is used.  Normally .copy will cause statements from the
     included file to be printed in the assembly listing and .include
     will not, but this distinction is not currently implemented.

`.data'
     Begin assembling code into the .data section.

`.double VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ldouble VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.float VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.xfloat VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place an IEEE single-precision floating-point representation of
     one or more floating-point values into the current section.  All
     but `.xfloat' align the result on a longword boundary.  Values are
     stored most-significant word first.

`.drlist'
`.drnolist'
     Control printing of directives to the listing file.  Ignored.

`.emsg STRING'
`.mmsg STRING'
`.wmsg STRING'
     Emit a user-defined error, message, or warning, respectively.

`.far_mode'
     Use extended addressing when assembling statements.  This should
     appear only once per file, and is equivalent to the -mfar-mode
     option *note `-mfar-mode': TIC54X-Opts.

`.fclist'
`.fcnolist'
     Control printing of false conditional blocks to the listing file.

`.field VALUE [,SIZE]'
     Initialize a bitfield of SIZE bits in the current section.  If
     VALUE is relocatable, then SIZE must be 16.  SIZE defaults to 16
     bits.  If VALUE does not fit into SIZE bits, the value will be
     truncated.  Successive `.field' directives will pack starting at
     the current word, filling the most significant bits first, and
     aligning to the start of the next word if the field size does not
     fit into the space remaining in the current word.  A `.align'
     directive with an operand of 1 will force the next `.field'
     directive to begin packing into a new word.  If a label is used, it
     points to the word that contains the specified field.

`.global SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
`.def SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
`.ref SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
     `.def' nominally identifies a symbol defined in the current file
     and available to other files.  `.ref' identifies a symbol used in
     the current file but defined elsewhere.  Both map to the standard
     `.global' directive.

`.half VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uhalf VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.short VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ushort VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.int VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uint VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.word VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uword VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more values into consecutive words of the current
     section.  If a label is used, it points to the word allocated for
     the first value encountered.

`.label SYMBOL'
     Define a special SYMBOL to refer to the load time address of the
     current section program counter.

`.length'
`.width'
     Set the page length and width of the output listing file.  Ignored.

`.list'
`.nolist'
     Control whether the source listing is printed.  Ignored.

`.long VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ulong VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.xlong VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more 32-bit values into consecutive words in the
     current section.  The most significant word is stored first.
     `.long' and `.ulong' align the result on a longword boundary;
     `xlong' does not.

`.loop [COUNT]'
`.break [CONDITION]'
`.endloop'
     Repeatedly assemble a block of code.  `.loop' begins the block, and
     `.endloop' marks its termination.  COUNT defaults to 1024, and
     indicates the number of times the block should be repeated.
     `.break' terminates the loop so that assembly begins after the
     `.endloop' directive.  The optional CONDITION will cause the loop
     to terminate only if it evaluates to zero.

`MACRO_NAME .macro [PARAM1][,...PARAM_N]'
`[.mexit]'
`.endm'
     See the section on macros for more explanation (*Note
     TIC54X-Macros::.

`.mlib "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
     Load the macro library FILENAME.  FILENAME must be an archived
     library (BFD ar-compatible) of text files, expected to contain
     only macro definitions.   The standard include search path is used.

`.mlist'
`.mnolist'
     Control whether to include macro and loop block expansions in the
     listing output.  Ignored.

`.mmregs'
     Define global symbolic names for the 'c54x registers.  Supposedly
     equivalent to executing `.set' directives for each register with
     its memory-mapped value, but in reality is provided only for
     compatibility and does nothing.

`.newblock'
     This directive resets any TIC54X local labels currently defined.
     Normal `as' local labels are unaffected.

`.option OPTION_LIST'
     Set listing options.  Ignored.

`.sblock "SECTION_NAME" | SECTION_NAME [,"NAME_N" | NAME_N]'
     Designate SECTION_NAME for blocking.  Blocking guarantees that a
     section will start on a page boundary (128 words) if it would
     otherwise cross a page boundary.  Only initialized sections may be
     designated with this directive.  See also *Note TIC54X-Block::.

`.sect "SECTION_NAME"'
     Define a named initialized section and make it the current section.

`SYMBOL .set "VALUE"'
`SYMBOL .equ "VALUE"'
     Equate a constant VALUE to a SYMBOL, which is placed in the symbol
     table.  SYMBOL may not be previously defined.

`.space SIZE_IN_BITS'
`.bes SIZE_IN_BITS'
     Reserve the given number of bits in the current section and
     zero-fill them.  If a label is used with `.space', it points to the
     *first* word reserved.  With `.bes', the label points to the
     *last* word reserved.

`.sslist'
`.ssnolist'
     Controls the inclusion of subsym replacement in the listing
     output.  Ignored.

`.string "STRING" [,...,"STRING_N"]'
`.pstring "STRING" [,...,"STRING_N"]'
     Place 8-bit characters from STRING into the current section.
     `.string' zero-fills the upper 8 bits of each word, while
     `.pstring' puts two characters into each word, filling the
     most-significant bits first.  Unused space is zero-filled.  If a
     label is used, it points to the first word initialized.

`[STAG] .struct [OFFSET]'
`[NAME_1] element [COUNT_1]'
`[NAME_2] element [COUNT_2]'
`[TNAME] .tag STAGX [TCOUNT]'
`...'
`[NAME_N] element [COUNT_N]'
`[SSIZE] .endstruct'
`LABEL .tag [STAG]'
     Assign symbolic offsets to the elements of a structure.  STAG
     defines a symbol to use to reference the structure.  OFFSET
     indicates a starting value to use for the first element
     encountered; otherwise it defaults to zero.  Each element can have
     a named offset, NAME, which is a symbol assigned the value of the
     element's offset into the structure.  If STAG is missing, these
     become global symbols.  COUNT adjusts the offset that many times,
     as if `element' were an array.  `element' may be one of `.byte',
     `.word', `.long', `.float', or any equivalent of those, and the
     structure offset is adjusted accordingly.  `.field' and `.string'
     are also allowed; the size of `.field' is one bit, and `.string'
     is considered to be one word in size.  Only element descriptors,
     structure/union tags, `.align' and conditional assembly directives
     are allowed within `.struct'/`.endstruct'.  `.align' aligns member
     offsets to word boundaries only.  SSIZE, if provided, will always
     be assigned the size of the structure.

     The `.tag' directive, in addition to being used to define a
     structure/union element within a structure, may be used to apply a
     structure to a symbol.  Once applied to LABEL, the individual
     structure elements may be applied to LABEL to produce the desired
     offsets using LABEL as the structure base.

`.tab'
     Set the tab size in the output listing.  Ignored.

`[UTAG] .union'
`[NAME_1] element [COUNT_1]'
`[NAME_2] element [COUNT_2]'
`[TNAME] .tag UTAGX[,TCOUNT]'
`...'
`[NAME_N] element [COUNT_N]'
`[USIZE] .endstruct'
`LABEL .tag [UTAG]'
     Similar to `.struct', but the offset after each element is reset to
     zero, and the USIZE is set to the maximum of all defined elements.
     Starting offset for the union is always zero.

`[SYMBOL] .usect "SECTION_NAME", SIZE, [,[BLOCKING_FLAG] [,ALIGNMENT_FLAG]]'
     Reserve space for variables in a named, uninitialized section
     (similar to .bss).  `.usect' allows definitions sections
     independent of .bss.  SYMBOL points to the first location reserved
     by this allocation.  The symbol may be used as a variable name.
     SIZE is the allocated size in words.  BLOCKING_FLAG indicates
     whether to block this section on a page boundary (128 words)
     (*note TIC54X-Block::).  ALIGNMENT FLAG indicates whether the
     section should be longword-aligned.

`.var SYM[,..., SYM_N]'
     Define a subsym to be a local variable within a macro.  See *Note
     TIC54X-Macros::.

`.version VERSION'
     Set which processor to build instructions for.  Though the
     following values are accepted, the op is ignored.
    `541'
    `542'
    `543'
    `545'
    `545LP'
    `546LP'
    `548'

9.40.10 Macros
--------------

Macros do not require explicit dereferencing of arguments (i.e., \ARG).

   During macro expansion, the macro parameters are converted to
subsyms.  If the number of arguments passed the macro invocation
exceeds the number of parameters defined, the last parameter is
assigned the string equivalent of all remaining arguments.  If fewer
arguments are given than parameters, the missing parameters are
assigned empty strings.  To include a comma in an argument, you must
enclose the argument in quotes.

   The following built-in subsym functions allow examination of the
string value of subsyms (or ordinary strings).  The arguments are
strings unless otherwise indicated (subsyms passed as args will be
replaced by the strings they represent).
``$symlen(STR)''
     Returns the length of STR.

``$symcmp(STR1,STR2)''
     Returns 0 if STR1 == STR2, non-zero otherwise.

``$firstch(STR,CH)''
     Returns index of the first occurrence of character constant CH in
     STR.

``$lastch(STR,CH)''
     Returns index of the last occurrence of character constant CH in
     STR.

``$isdefed(SYMBOL)''
     Returns zero if the symbol SYMBOL is not in the symbol table,
     non-zero otherwise.

``$ismember(SYMBOL,LIST)''
     Assign the first member of comma-separated string LIST to SYMBOL;
     LIST is reassigned the remainder of the list.  Returns zero if
     LIST is a null string.  Both arguments must be subsyms.

``$iscons(EXPR)''
     Returns 1 if string EXPR is binary, 2 if octal, 3 if hexadecimal,
     4 if a character, 5 if decimal, and zero if not an integer.

``$isname(NAME)''
     Returns 1 if NAME is a valid symbol name, zero otherwise.

``$isreg(REG)''
     Returns 1 if REG is a valid predefined register name (AR0-AR7
     only).

``$structsz(STAG)''
     Returns the size of the structure or union represented by STAG.

``$structacc(STAG)''
     Returns the reference point of the structure or union represented
     by STAG.   Always returns zero.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The presence of an asterisk (`*') at the start of a line also
indicates a comment that extends to the end of that line.

   The TIC54X assembler does not currently support a line separator
character.

9.41.1 TIC6X Options
--------------------

`-march=ARCH'
     Enable (only) instructions from architecture ARCH.  By default,
     all instructions are permitted.

     The following values of ARCH are accepted: `c62x', `c64x',
     `c64x+', `c67x', `c67x+', `c674x'.

`-mdsbt'
`-mno-dsbt'
     The `-mdsbt' option causes the assembler to generate the
     `Tag_ABI_DSBT' attribute with a value of 1, indicating that the
     code is using DSBT addressing.  The `-mno-dsbt' option, the
     default, causes the tag to have a value of 0, indicating that the
     code does not use DSBT addressing.  The linker will emit a warning
     if objects of different type (DSBT and non-DSBT) are linked
     together.

`-mpid=no'
`-mpid=near'
`-mpid=far'
     The `-mpid=' option causes the assembler to generate the
     `Tag_ABI_PID' attribute with a value indicating the form of data
     addressing used by the code.  `-mpid=no', the default, indicates
     position-dependent data addressing, `-mpid=near' indicates
     position-independent addressing with GOT accesses using near DP
     addressing, and `-mpid=far' indicates position-independent
     addressing with GOT accesses using far DP addressing.  The linker
     will emit a warning if objects built with different settings of
     this option are linked together.

`-mpic'
`-mno-pic'
     The `-mpic' option causes the assembler to generate the
     `Tag_ABI_PIC' attribute with a value of 1, indicating that the
     code is using position-independent code addressing,  The
     `-mno-pic' option, the default, causes the tag to have a value of
     0, indicating position-dependent code addressing.  The linker will
     emit a warning if objects of different type (position-dependent and
     position-independent) are linked together.

`-mbig-endian'
`-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for the specified endianness.  The default is
     little-endian.

9.41.2 TIC6X Syntax
-------------------

The presence of a `;' on a line indicates the start of a comment that
extends to the end of the current line.  If a `#' or `*' appears as the
first character of a line, the whole line is treated as a comment.
Note that if a line starts with a `#' character then it can also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The `@' character can be used instead of a newline to separate
statements.

   Instruction, register and functional unit names are case-insensitive.
`as' requires fully-specified functional unit names, such as `.S1',
`.L1X' or `.D1T2', on all instructions using a functional unit.

   For some instructions, there may be syntactic ambiguity between
register or functional unit names and the names of labels or other
symbols.  To avoid this, enclose the ambiguous symbol name in
parentheses; register and functional unit names may not be enclosed in
parentheses.

9.41.3 TIC6X Directives
-----------------------

Directives controlling the set of instructions accepted by the
assembler have effect for instructions between the directive and any
subsequent directive overriding it.

`.arch ARCH'
     This has the same effect as `-march=ARCH'.

`.cantunwind'
     Prevents unwinding through the current function.  No personality
     routine or exception table data is required or permitted.

     If this is not specified then frame unwinding information will be
     constructed from CFI directives. *note CFI directives::.

`.c6xabi_attribute TAG, VALUE'
     Set the C6000 EABI build attribute TAG to VALUE.

     The TAG is either an attribute number or one of `Tag_ISA',
     `Tag_ABI_wchar_t', `Tag_ABI_stack_align_needed',
     `Tag_ABI_stack_align_preserved', `Tag_ABI_DSBT', `Tag_ABI_PID',
     `Tag_ABI_PIC', `TAG_ABI_array_object_alignment',
     `TAG_ABI_array_object_align_expected', `Tag_ABI_compatibility' and
     `Tag_ABI_conformance'.  The VALUE is either a `number',
     `"string"', or `number, "string"' depending on the tag.

`.ehtype SYMBOL'
     Output an exception type table reference to SYMBOL.

`.endp'
     Marks the end of and exception table or function.  If preceeded by
     a `.handlerdata' directive then this also switched back to the
     previous text section.

`.handlerdata'
     Marks the end of the current function, and the start of the
     exception table entry for that function.  Anything between this
     directive and the `.endp' directive will be added to the exception
     table entry.

     Must be preceded by a CFI block containing a `.cfi_lsda' directive.

`.nocmp'
     Disallow use of C64x+ compact instructions in the current text
     section.

`.personalityindex INDEX'
     Sets the personality routine for the current function to the ABI
     specified compact routine number INDEX

`.personality NAME'
     Sets the personality routine for the current function to NAME.

`.scomm SYMBOL, SIZE, ALIGN'
     Like `.comm', creating a common symbol SYMBOL with size SIZE and
     alignment ALIGN, but unlike when using `.comm', this symbol will
     be placed into the small BSS section by the linker.

9.42.2 Syntax
-------------

Block comments are delimited by `/*' and `*/'.  End of line comments
may be introduced by `#'.

   Instructions consist of a leading opcode or macro name followed by
whitespace and an optional comma-separated list of operands:

     OPCODE [OPERAND, ...]

   Instructions must be separated by a newline or semicolon.

   There are two ways to write code: either write naked instructions,
which the assembler is free to combine into VLIW bundles, or specify
the VLIW bundles explicitly.

   Bundles are specified using curly braces:

     { ADD r3,r4,r5 ; ADD r7,r8,r9 ; LW r10,r11 }

   A bundle can span multiple lines. If you want to put multiple
instructions on a line, whether in a bundle or not, you need to
separate them with semicolons as in this example.

   A bundle may contain one or more instructions, up to the limit
specified by the ISA (currently three). If fewer instructions are
specified than the hardware supports in a bundle, the assembler inserts
`fnop' instructions automatically.

   The assembler will prefer to preserve the ordering of instructions
within the bundle, putting the first instruction in a lower-numbered
pipeline than the next one, etc.  This fact, combined with the optional
use of explicit `fnop' or `nop' instructions, allows precise control
over which pipeline executes each instruction.

   If the instructions cannot be bundled in the listed order, the
assembler will automatically try to find a valid pipeline assignment.
If there is no way to bundle the instructions together, the assembler
reports an error.

   The assembler does not yet auto-bundle (automatically combine
multiple instructions into one bundle), but it reserves the right to do
so in the future.  If you want to force an instruction to run by
itself, put it in a bundle explicitly with curly braces and use `nop'
instructions (not `fnop') to fill the remaining pipeline slots in that
bundle.

9.42.2.2 Register Names
.......................

General-purpose registers are represented by predefined symbols of the
form `rN', where N represents a number between `0' and `63'.  However,
the following registers have canonical names that must be used instead:

`r54'
     sp

`r55'
     lr

`r56'
     sn

`r57'
     idn0

`r58'
     idn1

`r59'
     udn0

`r60'
     udn1

`r61'
     udn2

`r62'
     udn3

`r63'
     zero


   The assembler will emit a warning if a numeric name is used instead
of the non-numeric name.  The `.no_require_canonical_reg_names'
assembler pseudo-op turns off this warning.
`.require_canonical_reg_names' turns it back on.

9.42.2.3 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
...................................

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses in
TILE-Gx instruction operands.  The general syntax is the following:

     modifier(symbol)

   The following modifiers are supported:

`hw0'
     This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the symbol's address.

`hw1'
     This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the symbol's address.

`hw2'
     This modifier is used to load bits 32-47 of the symbol's address.

`hw3'
     This modifier is used to load bits 48-63 of the symbol's address.

`hw0_last'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw0', but it also checks
     that the value does not overflow.

`hw1_last'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw1', but it also checks
     that the value does not overflow.

`hw2_last'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw2', but it also checks
     that the value does not overflow.

     A 48-bit symbolic value is constructed by using the following
     idiom:

          moveli r0, hw2_last(sym)
          shl16insli r0, r0, hw1(sym)
          shl16insli r0, r0, hw0(sym)

`hw0_got'
     This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the symbol's offset in
     the GOT entry corresponding to the symbol.

`hw0_last_got'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw0_got', but it also
     checks that the value does not overflow.

`hw1_last_got'
     This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the symbol's offset in
     the GOT entry corresponding to the symbol, and it also checks that
     the value does not overflow.

`plt'
     This modifier is used for function symbols.  It causes a
     _procedure linkage table_, an array of code stubs, to be created
     at the time the shared object is created or linked against,
     together with a global offset table entry.  The value is a
     pc-relative offset to the corresponding stub code in the procedure
     linkage table.  This arrangement causes the run-time symbol
     resolver to be called to look up and set the value of the symbol
     the first time the function is called (at latest; depending
     environment variables).  It is only safe to leave the symbol
     unresolved this way if all references are function calls.

`hw0_plt'
     This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the pc-relative address
     of a plt entry.

`hw1_plt'
     This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the pc-relative
     address of a plt entry.

`hw1_last_plt'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw1_plt', but it also
     checks that the value does not overflow.

`hw2_last_plt'
     This modifier is used to load bits 32-47 of the pc-relative
     address of a plt entry, and it also checks that the value does not
     overflow.

`hw0_tls_gd'
     This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the offset of the GOT
     entry of the symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used for
     general-dynamic TLS accesses.

`hw0_last_tls_gd'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw0_tls_gd', but it also
     checks that the value does not overflow.

`hw1_last_tls_gd'
     This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the offset of the GOT
     entry of the symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used for
     general-dynamic TLS accesses.  It also checks that the value does
     not overflow.

`hw0_tls_ie'
     This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the offset of the GOT

9.43.2 Syntax
-------------

Block comments are delimited by `/*' and `*/'.  End of line comments
may be introduced by `#'.

   Instructions consist of a leading opcode or macro name followed by
whitespace and an optional comma-separated list of operands:

     OPCODE [OPERAND, ...]

   Instructions must be separated by a newline or semicolon.

   There are two ways to write code: either write naked instructions,
which the assembler is free to combine into VLIW bundles, or specify
the VLIW bundles explicitly.

   Bundles are specified using curly braces:

     { ADD r3,r4,r5 ; ADD r7,r8,r9 ; LW r10,r11 }

   A bundle can span multiple lines. If you want to put multiple
instructions on a line, whether in a bundle or not, you need to
separate them with semicolons as in this example.

   A bundle may contain one or more instructions, up to the limit
specified by the ISA (currently three). If fewer instructions are
specified than the hardware supports in a bundle, the assembler inserts
`fnop' instructions automatically.

   The assembler will prefer to preserve the ordering of instructions
within the bundle, putting the first instruction in a lower-numbered
pipeline than the next one, etc.  This fact, combined with the optional
use of explicit `fnop' or `nop' instructions, allows precise control
over which pipeline executes each instruction.

   If the instructions cannot be bundled in the listed order, the
assembler will automatically try to find a valid pipeline assignment.
If there is no way to bundle the instructions together, the assembler
reports an error.

   The assembler does not yet auto-bundle (automatically combine
multiple instructions into one bundle), but it reserves the right to do
so in the future.  If you want to force an instruction to run by
itself, put it in a bundle explicitly with curly braces and use `nop'
instructions (not `fnop') to fill the remaining pipeline slots in that
bundle.

9.43.2.2 Register Names
.......................

General-purpose registers are represented by predefined symbols of the
form `rN', where N represents a number between `0' and `63'.  However,
the following registers have canonical names that must be used instead:

`r54'
     sp

`r55'
     lr

`r56'
     sn

`r57'
     idn0

`r58'
     idn1

`r59'
     udn0

`r60'
     udn1

`r61'
     udn2

`r62'
     udn3

`r63'
     zero


   The assembler will emit a warning if a numeric name is used instead
of the canonical name.  The `.no_require_canonical_reg_names' assembler
pseudo-op turns off this warning. `.require_canonical_reg_names' turns
it back on.

9.43.2.3 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
...................................

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses in
TILEPro instruction operands.  The general syntax is the following:

     modifier(symbol)

   The following modifiers are supported:

`lo16'
     This modifier is used to load the low 16 bits of the symbol's
     address, sign-extended to a 32-bit value (sign-extension allows it
     to be range-checked against signed 16 bit immediate operands
     without complaint).

`hi16'
     This modifier is used to load the high 16 bits of the symbol's
     address, also sign-extended to a 32-bit value.

`ha16'
     `ha16(N)' is identical to `hi16(N)', except if `lo16(N)' is
     negative it adds one to the `hi16(N)' value. This way `lo16' and
     `ha16' can be added to create any 32-bit value using `auli'.  For
     example, here is how you move an arbitrary 32-bit address into r3:

          moveli r3, lo16(sym)
          auli r3, r3, ha16(sym)

`got'
     This modifier is used to load the offset of the GOT entry
     corresponding to the symbol.

`got_lo16'
     This modifier is used to load the sign-extended low 16 bits of the
     offset of the GOT entry corresponding to the symbol.

`got_hi16'
     This modifier is used to load the sign-extended high 16 bits of the
     offset of the GOT entry corresponding to the symbol.

`got_ha16'
     This modifier is like `got_hi16', but it adds one if `got_lo16' of
     the input value is negative.

`plt'
     This modifier is used for function symbols.  It causes a
     _procedure linkage table_, an array of code stubs, to be created
     at the time the shared object is created or linked against,
     together with a global offset table entry.  The value is a
     pc-relative offset to the corresponding stub code in the procedure
     linkage table.  This arrangement causes the run-time symbol
     resolver to be called to look up and set the value of the symbol
     the first time the function is called (at latest; depending
     environment variables).  It is only safe to leave the symbol
     unresolved this way if all references are function calls.

`tls_gd'
     This modifier is used to load the offset of the GOT entry of the
     symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used for general-dynamic TLS
     accesses.

`tls_gd_lo16'
     This modifier is used to load the sign-extended low 16 bits of the
     offset of the GOT entry of the symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used
     for general dynamic TLS accesses.

`tls_gd_hi16'
     This modifier is used to load the sign-extended high 16 bits of the
     offset of the GOT entry of the symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used
     for general dynamic TLS accesses.

`tls_gd_ha16'
     This modifier is like `tls_gd_hi16', but it adds one to the value
     if `tls_gd_lo16' of the input value is negative.

`tls_ie'
     This modifier is used to load the offset of the GOT entry
     containing the offset of the symbol's address from the TCB, to be
     used for initial-exec TLS accesses.

`tls_ie_lo16'
     This modifier is used to load the low 16 bits of the offset of the
     GOT entry containing the offset of the symbol's address from the
     TCB, to be used for initial-exec TLS accesses.

`tls_ie_hi16'
     This modifier is used to load the high 16 bits of the offset of the
     GOT entry containing the offset of the symbol's address from the
     TCB, to be used for initial-exec TLS accesses.

`tls_ie_ha16'
     This modifier is like `tls_ie_hi16', but it adds one to the value
     if `tls_ie_lo16' of the input value is negative.

`tls_le'
     This modifier is used to load the offset of the symbol's address
     from the TCB, to be used for local-exec TLS accesses.

`tls_le_lo16'
     This modifier is used to load the low 16 bits of the offset of the
     symbol's address from the TCB, to be used for local-exec TLS
     accesses.

`tls_le_hi16'
     This modifier is used to load the high 16 bits of the offset of the
     symbol's address from the TCB, to be used for local-exec TLS
     accesses.

`tls_le_ha16'
     This modifier is like `tls_le_hi16', but it adds one to the value
     if `tls_le_lo16' of the input value is negative.

`tls_gd_call'
     This modifier is used to tag an instrution as the "call" part of a
     calling sequence for a TLS GD reference of its operand.

`tls_gd_add'
     This modifier is used to tag an instruction as the "add" part of a
     calling sequence for a TLS GD reference of its operand.

`tls_ie_load'
     This modifier is used to tag an instruction as the "load" part of a
     calling sequence for a TLS IE reference of its operand.

9.44.1 Options
--------------

The Zilog Z80 and Ascii R800 version of `as' have a few machine
dependent options.
`-z80'
     Produce code for the Z80 processor. There are additional options to
     request warnings and error messages for undocumented instructions.

`-ignore-undocumented-instructions'
`-Wnud'
     Silently assemble undocumented Z80-instructions that have been
     adopted as documented R800-instructions.

`-ignore-unportable-instructions'
`-Wnup'
     Silently assemble all undocumented Z80-instructions.

`-warn-undocumented-instructions'
`-Wud'
     Issue warnings for undocumented Z80-instructions that work on
     R800, do not assemble other undocumented instructions without
     warning.

`-warn-unportable-instructions'
`-Wup'
     Issue warnings for other undocumented Z80-instructions, do not
     treat any undocumented instructions as errors.

`-forbid-undocumented-instructions'
`-Fud'
     Treat all undocumented z80-instructions as errors.

`-forbid-unportable-instructions'
`-Fup'
     Treat undocumented z80-instructions that do not work on R800 as
     errors.

`-r800'
     Produce code for the R800 processor. The assembler does not support
     undocumented instructions for the R800.  In line with common
     practice, `as' uses Z80 instruction names for the R800 processor,
     as far as they exist.

9.44.2 Syntax
-------------

The assembler syntax closely follows the 'Z80 family CPU User Manual' by
Zilog.  In expressions a single `=' may be used as "is equal to"
comparison operator.

   Suffices can be used to indicate the radix of integer constants; `H'
or `h' for hexadecimal, `D' or `d' for decimal, `Q', `O', `q' or `o'
for octal, and `B' for binary.

   The suffix `b' denotes a backreference to local label.

File: as.info,  Node: Z80-Chars,  Next: Z80-Regs,  Up: Z80 Syntax

9.44.2.1 Special Characters
...........................

The semicolon `;' is the line comment character;

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The Z80 assembler does not support a line separator character.

   The dollar sign `$' can be used as a prefix for hexadecimal numbers
and as a symbol denoting the current location counter.

   A backslash `\' is an ordinary character for the Z80 assembler.

   The single quote `'' must be followed by a closing quote. If there
is one character in between, it is a character constant, otherwise it is
a string constant.

9.44.2.2 Register Names
.......................

The registers are referred to with the letters assigned to them by
Zilog. In addition `as' recognizes `ixl' and `ixh' as the least and
most significant octet in `ix', and similarly `iyl' and  `iyh' as parts
of `iy'.


File: as.info,  Node: Z80-Case,  Prev: Z80-Regs,  Up: Z80 Syntax

9.44.2.3 Case Sensitivity
.........................

Upper and lower case are equivalent in register names, opcodes,
condition codes  and assembler directives.  The case of letters is
significant in labels and symbol names. The case is also important to
distinguish the suffix `b' for a backward reference to a local label
from the suffix `B' for a number in binary notation.

9.44.4 Z80 Assembler Directives
-------------------------------

`as' for the Z80 supports some additional directives for compatibility
with other assemblers.

   These are the additional directives in `as' for the Z80:

`db EXPRESSION|STRING[,EXPRESSION|STRING...]'
`defb EXPRESSION|STRING[,EXPRESSION|STRING...]'
     For each STRING the characters are copied to the object file, for
     each other EXPRESSION the value is stored in one byte.  A warning
     is issued in case of an overflow.

`dw EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
`defw EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
     For each EXPRESSION the value is stored in two bytes, ignoring
     overflow.

`d24 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
`def24 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
     For each EXPRESSION the value is stored in three bytes, ignoring
     overflow.

`d32 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
`def32 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
     For each EXPRESSION the value is stored in four bytes, ignoring
     overflow.

`ds COUNT[, VALUE]'
`defs COUNT[, VALUE]'
     Fill COUNT bytes in the object file with VALUE, if VALUE is
     omitted it defaults to zero.

`SYMBOL equ EXPRESSION'
`SYMBOL defl EXPRESSION'
     These directives set the value of SYMBOL to EXPRESSION. If `equ'
     is used, it is an error if SYMBOL is already defined.  Symbols
     defined with `equ' are not protected from redefinition.

`set'
     This is a normal instruction on Z80, and not an assembler
     directive.

`psect NAME'
     A synonym for *Note Section::, no second argument should be given.



File: as.info,  Node: Z80 Opcodes,  Prev: Z80 Directives,  Up: Z80-Dependent

9.44.5 Opcodes
--------------

In line with common practice, Z80 mnemonics are used for both the Z80
and the R800.

   In many instructions it is possible to use one of the half index
registers (`ixl',`ixh',`iyl',`iyh') in stead of an 8-bit general
purpose register. This yields instructions that are documented on the
R800 and undocumented on the Z80.  Similarly `in f,(c)' is documented
on the R800 and undocumented on the Z80.

   The assembler also supports the following undocumented
Z80-instructions, that have not been adopted in the R800 instruction
set:
`out (c),0'
     Sends zero to the port pointed to by register c.

`sli M'
     Equivalent to `M = (M<<1)+1', the operand M can be any operand
     that is valid for `sla'. One can use `sll' as a synonym for `sli'.

`OP (ix+D), R'
     This is equivalent to

          ld R, (ix+D)
          OPC R
          ld (ix+D), R

     The operation `OPC' may be any of `res B,', `set B,', `rl', `rlc',
     `rr', `rrc', `sla', `sli', `sra' and `srl', and the register `R'
     may be any of `a', `b', `c', `d', `e', `h' and `l'.

`OPC (iy+D), R'
     As above, but with `iy' instead of `ix'.

   The web site at `http://www.z80.info' is a good starting place to
find more information on programming the Z80.

9.45 Z8000 Dependent Features
=============================

   The Z8000 as supports both members of the Z8000 family: the
unsegmented Z8002, with 16 bit addresses, and the segmented Z8001 with
24 bit addresses.

   When the assembler is in unsegmented mode (specified with the
`unsegm' directive), an address takes up one word (16 bit) sized
register.  When the assembler is in segmented mode (specified with the
`segm' directive), a 24-bit address takes up a long (32 bit) register.

     Indexed: the 16 or 24 bit address is added to the 16 bit register
     to produce the final address in memory of the operand.

`rN(#IMM)'
`rrN(#IMM)'
     Base Address: the 16 or 24 bit register is added to the 16 bit sign
     extended immediate displacement to produce the final address in
     memory of the operand.

`rN(rM)'
`rrN(rM)'
     Base Index: the 16 or 24 bit register rN or rrN is added to the

compatibility with other Z8000 assemblers.  These do not begin with `.'
(unlike the ordinary as directives).

`segm'
`.z8001'
     Generate code for the segmented Z8001.

`unsegm'
`.z8002'
     Generate code for the unsegmented Z8002.

`name'
     Synonym for `.file'

`global'
     Synonym for `.global'

`wval'
     Synonym for `.word'

`lval'
     Synonym for `.long'

`bval'
     Synonym for `.byte'

`sval'
     Assemble a string.  `sval' expects one string literal, delimited by
     single quotes.  It assembles each byte of the string into
     consecutive addresses.  You can use the escape sequence `%XX'
     (where XX represents a two-digit hexadecimal number) to represent
     the character whose ASCII value is XX.  Use this feature to
     describe single quote and other characters that may not appear in
     string literals as themselves.  For example, the C statement
     `char *a = "he said \"it's 50% off\"";' is represented in Z8000
     assembly language (shown with the assembler output in hex at the
     left) as

          68652073    sval    'he said %22it%27s 50%25 off%22%00'
          61696420
          22697427
          73203530
          25206F66
          662200

`rsect'
     synonym for `.section'

`block'
     synonym for `.space'

`even'
     special case of `.align'; aligns output to even byte boundary.

9.46.1 VAX Command-Line Options
-------------------------------

The Vax version of `as' accepts any of the following options, gives a
warning message that the option was ignored and proceeds.  These
options are for compatibility with scripts designed for other people's
assemblers.

``-D' (Debug)'
``-S' (Symbol Table)'
``-T' (Token Trace)'
     These are obsolete options used to debug old assemblers.

``-d' (Displacement size for JUMPs)'
     This option expects a number following the `-d'.  Like options
     that expect filenames, the number may immediately follow the `-d'
     (old standard) or constitute the whole of the command line
     argument that follows `-d' (GNU standard).

``-V' (Virtualize Interpass Temporary File)'
     Some other assemblers use a temporary file.  This option commanded
     them to keep the information in active memory rather than in a
     disk file.  `as' always does this, so this option is redundant.

``-J' (JUMPify Longer Branches)'
     Many 32-bit computers permit a variety of branch instructions to
     do the same job.  Some of these instructions are short (and fast)
     but have a limited range; others are long (and slow) but can
     branch anywhere in virtual memory.  Often there are 3 flavors of
     branch: short, medium and long.  Some other assemblers would emit
     short and medium branches, unless told by this option to emit
     short and long branches.

``-t' (Temporary File Directory)'
     Some other assemblers may use a temporary file, and this option
     takes a filename being the directory to site the temporary file.
     Since `as' does not use a temporary disk file, this option makes
     no difference.  `-t' needs exactly one filename.

   The Vax version of the assembler accepts additional options when
compiled for VMS:

`-h N'
     External symbol or section (used for global variables) names are
     not case sensitive on VAX/VMS and always mapped to upper case.
     This is contrary to the C language definition which explicitly
     distinguishes upper and lower case.  To implement a standard
     conforming C compiler, names must be changed (mapped) to preserve
     the case information.  The default mapping is to convert all lower
     case characters to uppercase and adding an underscore followed by
     a 6 digit hex value, representing a 24 digit binary value.  The
     one digits in the binary value represent which characters are
     uppercase in the original symbol name.

     The `-h N' option determines how we map names.  This takes several
     values.  No `-h' switch at all allows case hacking as described
     above.  A value of zero (`-h0') implies names should be upper
     case, and inhibits the case hack.  A value of 2 (`-h2') implies
     names should be all lower case, with no case hack.  A value of 3
     (`-h3') implies that case should be preserved.  The value 1 is
     unused.  The `-H' option directs `as' to display every mapped
     symbol during assembly.

     Symbols whose names include a dollar sign `$' are exceptions to the
     general name mapping.  These symbols are normally only used to
     reference VMS library names.  Such symbols are always mapped to
     upper case.

`-+'
     The `-+' option causes `as' to truncate any symbol name larger
     than 31 characters.  The `-+' option also prevents some code
     following the `_main' symbol normally added to make the object
     file compatible with Vax-11 "C".

`-1'
     This option is ignored for backward compatibility with `as'
     version 1.x.

`-H'
     The `-H' option causes `as' to print every symbol which was
     changed by case mapping.

9.46.2 VAX Floating Point
-------------------------

Conversion of flonums to floating point is correct, and compatible with
previous assemblers.  Rounding is towards zero if the remainder is
exactly half the least significant bit.

   `D', `F', `G' and `H' floating point formats are understood.

   Immediate floating literals (_e.g._ `S`$6.9') are rendered
correctly.  Again, rounding is towards zero in the boundary case.

   The `.float' directive produces `f' format numbers.  The `.double'
directive produces `d' format numbers.

9.46.3 Vax Machine Directives
-----------------------------

The Vax version of the assembler supports four directives for
generating Vax floating point constants.  They are described in the
table below.

`.dfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `d' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.ffloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `f' format 32-bit floating point constants.

`.gfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `g' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.hfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `h' format 128-bit floating point constants.

9.46.4 VAX Opcodes
------------------

All DEC mnemonics are supported.  Beware that `case...' instructions
have exactly 3 operands.  The dispatch table that follows the `case...'
instruction should be made with `.word' statements.  This is compatible
with all unix assemblers we know of.

9.46.5 VAX Branch Improvement
-----------------------------

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted.  They are for branch
instructions.  They expand to the shortest branch instruction that
reaches the target.  Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting
`j' for `b' at the start of a DEC mnemonic.  This feature is included
both for compatibility and to help compilers.  If you do not need this
feature, avoid these opcodes.  Here are the mnemonics, and the code
they can expand into.

`jbsb'
     `Jsb' is already an instruction mnemonic, so we chose `jbsb'.
    (byte displacement)
          `bsbb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bsbw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jsb ...'

`jbr'
`jr'
     Unconditional branch.
    (byte displacement)
          `brb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `brw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jmp ...'

`jCOND'
     COND may be any one of the conditional branches `neq', `nequ',
     `eql', `eqlu', `gtr', `geq', `lss', `gtru', `lequ', `vc', `vs',
     `gequ', `cc', `lssu', `cs'.  COND may also be one of the bit tests
     `bs', `bc', `bss', `bcs', `bsc', `bcc', `bssi', `bcci', `lbs',
     `lbc'.  NOTCOND is the opposite condition to COND.
    (byte displacement)
          `bCOND ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; brw ... ; foo:'

    (long displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; jmp ... ; foo:'

`jacbX'
     X may be one of `b d f g h l w'.
    (word displacement)
          `OPCODE ...'

    (long displacement)
               OPCODE ..., foo ;
               brb bar ;
               foo: jmp ... ;
               bar:

`jaobYYY'
     YYY may be one of `lss leq'.

`jsobZZZ'
     ZZZ may be one of `geq gtr'.
    (byte displacement)
          `OPCODE ...'

    (word displacement)
               OPCODE ..., foo ;

9.46.6 VAX Operands
-------------------

The immediate character is `$' for Unix compatibility, not `#' as DEC
writes it.

   The indirect character is `*' for Unix compatibility, not `@' as DEC
writes it.

   The displacement sizing character is ``' (an accent grave) for Unix
compatibility, not `^' as DEC writes it.  The letter preceding ``' may
have either case.  `G' is not understood, but all other letters (`b i l
s w') are understood.

   Register names understood are `r0 r1 r2 ... r15 ap fp sp pc'.  Upper
and lower case letters are equivalent.

   For instance
     tstb *w`$4(r5)

   Any expression is permitted in an operand.  Operands are comma
separated.

9.47.1 Options
--------------

`as' supports the following additional command-line options for the
V850 processor family:

`-wsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when signed immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-wunsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when unsigned immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-mv850'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e1'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E1 processor.  This allows the linker to
     detect attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850any'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor but support instructions that are
     specific to the extended variants of the process.  This allows the
     production of binaries that contain target specific code, but
     which are also intended to be used in a generic fashion.  For
     example libgcc.a contains generic routines used by the code
     produced by GCC for all versions of the v850 architecture,
     together with support routines only used by the V850E architecture.

`-mv850e2'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E2 processor.  This allows the linker to
     detect attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e2v3'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E2V3 processor.  This allows the linker to
     detect attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mrelax'
     Enables relaxation.  This allows the .longcall and .longjump pseudo
     ops to be used in the assembler source code.  These ops label
     sections of code which are either a long function call or a long
     branch.  The assembler will then flag these sections of code and
     the linker will attempt to relax them.

`-mgcc-abi'
     Marks the generated objecy file as supporting the old GCC ABI.

`-mrh850-abi'
     Marks the generated objecy file as supporting the RH850 ABI.  This
     is the default.

`-m8byte-align'
     Marks the generated objecy file as supporting a maximum 64-bits of
     alignment for variables defined in the source code.

`-m4byte-align'
     Marks the generated objecy file as supporting a maximum 32-bits of
     alignment for variables defined in the source code.  This is the
     default.

File: as.info,  Node: V850 Opcodes,  Prev: V850 Directives,  Up: V850-Dependent

9.47.5 Opcodes
--------------

`as' implements all the standard V850 opcodes.

   `as' also implements the following pseudo ops:

`hi0()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `mulhi hi0(here - there), r5, r6'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the upper 16 bits of this difference, shifts it
     down 16 bits and then multiplies it by the lower 16 bits in
     register 5, putting the result into register 6.

`lo()'
     Computes the lower 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `addi lo(here - there), r5, r6'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the lower 16 bits of this difference and adds it to
     register 5, putting the result into register 6.

`hi()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and then adds
     the value of the most significant bit of the lower 16 bits of the
     expression and stores the result into the immediate operand field
     of the given instruction.  For example the following code can be
     used to compute the address of the label 'here' and store it into
     register 6:

     `movhi hi(here), r0, r6'     `movea lo(here), r6, r6'

     The reason for this special behaviour is that movea performs a sign
     extension on its immediate operand.  So for example if the address
     of 'here' was 0xFFFFFFFF then without the special behaviour of the
     hi() pseudo-op the movhi instruction would put 0xFFFF0000 into r6,
     then the movea instruction would takes its immediate operand,
     0xFFFF, sign extend it to 32 bits, 0xFFFFFFFF, and then add it
     into r6 giving 0xFFFEFFFF which is wrong (the fifth nibble is E).
     With the hi() pseudo op adding in the top bit of the lo() pseudo
     op, the movhi instruction actually stores 0 into r6 (0xFFFF + 1 =
     0x0000), so that the movea instruction stores 0xFFFFFFFF into r6 -
     the right value.

`hilo()'
     Computes the 32 bit value of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction (which
     must be a mov instruction).  For example:

     `mov hilo(here), r6'

     computes the absolute address of label 'here' and puts the result
     into register 6.

`sdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Small Data Area (whoes address is held in register 4, the GP
     register) and stores the result as a 16 bit signed value in the
     immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     `ld.w sdaoff(_a_variable)[gp],r6'

     loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label
     '_a_variable' into register 6, provided that the label is located
     somewhere within +/- 32K of the address held in the GP register.
     [Note the linker assumes that the GP register contains a fixed
     address set to the address of the label called '__gp'.  This can
     either be set up automatically by the linker, or specifically set
     by using the `--defsym __gp=<value>' command line option].

`tdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Tiny Data Area (whoes address is held in register 30, the EP
     register) and stores the result as a 4,5, 7 or 8 bit unsigned
     value in the immediate operand field of the given instruction.
     For example:

     `sld.w tdaoff(_a_variable)[ep],r6'

     loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label
     '_a_variable' into register 6, provided that the label is located
     somewhere within +256 bytes of the address held in the EP
     register.  [Note the linker assumes that the EP register contains
     a fixed address set to the address of the label called '__ep'.
     This can either be set up automatically by the linker, or
     specifically set by using the `--defsym __ep=<value>' command line
     option].

`zdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from address 0 and
     stores the result as a 16 bit signed value in the immediate
     operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     `movea zdaoff(_a_variable),zero,r6'

     puts the address of the label '_a_variable' into register 6,
     assuming that the label is somewhere within the first 32K of
     memory.  (Strictly speaking it also possible to access the last
     32K of memory as well, as the offsets are signed).

`ctoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Call Table Area (whoes address is helg in system register 20, the
     CTBP register) and stores the result a 6 or 16 bit unsigned value
     in the immediate field of then given instruction or piece of data.
     For example:

     `callt ctoff(table_func1)'

     will put the call the function whoes address is held in the call
     table at the location labeled 'table_func1'.

`.longcall `name''
     Indicates that the following sequence of instructions is a long
     call to function `name'.  The linker will attempt to shorten this
     call sequence if `name' is within a 22bit offset of the call.  Only
     valid if the `-mrelax' command line switch has been enabled.

`.longjump `name''
     Indicates that the following sequence of instructions is a long
     jump to label `name'.  The linker will attempt to shorten this code
     sequence if `name' is within a 22bit offset of the jump.  Only
     valid if the `-mrelax' command line switch has been enabled.

`-mshort'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 16-bit integer
     ABI.  It has no effect on the assembled instructions.  This is the
     default.

`-mlong'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit integer
     ABI.

`-mshort-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit float
     ABI.  This is the default.

`-mlong-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 64-bit float
     ABI.

`--print-insn-syntax'
     You can use the `--print-insn-syntax' option to obtain the syntax
     description of the instruction when an error is detected.

`--print-opcodes'
     The `--print-opcodes' option prints the list of all the
     instructions with their syntax. Once the list is printed `as'
     exits.

9.48.2 Syntax
-------------

In XGATE RISC syntax, the instruction name comes first and it may be
followed by up to three operands. Operands are separated by commas
(`,'). `as' will complain if too many operands are specified for a
given instruction. The same will happen if you specified too few
operands.

     nop
     ldl  #23
     CMP  R1, R2

   The presence of a `;' character or a `!' character anywhere on a
line indicates the start of a comment that extends to the end of that
line.

   A `*' or a `#' character at the start of a line also introduces a
line comment, but these characters do not work elsewhere on the line.
If the first character of the line is a `#' then as well as starting a
comment, the line could also be logical line number directive (*note
Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The XGATE assembler does not currently support a line separator
character.

   The following addressing modes are understood for XGATE:
"Inherent"
     `'

"Immediate 3 Bit Wide"
     `#NUMBER'

"Immediate 4 Bit Wide"
     `#NUMBER'

"Immediate 8 Bit Wide"
     `#NUMBER'

"Monadic Addressing"
     `REG'

"Dyadic Addressing"
     `REG, REG'

"Triadic Addressing"
     `REG, REG, REG'

"Relative Addressing 9 Bit Wide"
     `*SYMBOL'

"Relative Addressing 10 Bit Wide"
     `*SYMBOL'

"Index Register plus Immediate Offset"
     `REG, (REG, #NUMBER)'

"Index Register plus Register Offset"
     `REG, REG, REG'

"Index Register plus Register Offset with Post-increment"
     `REG, REG, REG+'

"Index Register plus Register Offset with Pre-decrement"
     `REG, REG, -REG'

     The register can be either `R0', `R1', `R2', `R3', `R4', `R5',
     `R6' or `R7'.


   Convience macro opcodes to deal with 16-bit values have been added.

"Immediate 16 Bit Wide"
     `#NUMBER', or `*SYMBOL'

     For example:

          ldw R1, #1024
          ldw R3, timer
          ldw R1, (R1, #0)
          COM R1
          stw R2, (R1, #0)

`as' implements all the standard XStormy16 opcodes.

   `as' also implements the following pseudo ops:

`@lo()'
     Computes the lower 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `add r6, @lo(here - there)'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the lower 16 bits of this difference and adds it to
     register 6.

`@hi()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `addc r7, @hi(here - there)'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the upper 16 bits of this difference, shifts it
     down 16 bits and then adds it, along with the carry bit, to the
     value in register 7.

9.50.1 Command Line Options
---------------------------

`--text-section-literals | --no-text-section-literals'
     Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
     `--no-text-section-literals', which places literals in separate
     sections in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be
     placed in a data RAM/ROM.  With `--text-section-literals', the
     literals are interspersed in the text section in order to keep
     them as close as possible to their references.  This may be
     necessary for large assembly files, where the literals would
     otherwise be out of range of the `L32R' instructions in the text
     section.  These options only affect literals referenced via
     PC-relative `L32R' instructions; literals for absolute mode `L32R'
     instructions are handled separately.  *Note literal: Literal
     Directive.

`--absolute-literals | --no-absolute-literals'
     Indicate to the assembler whether `L32R' instructions use absolute
     or PC-relative addressing.  If the processor includes the absolute
     addressing option, the default is to use absolute `L32R'
     relocations.  Otherwise, only the PC-relative `L32R' relocations
     can be used.

`--target-align | --no-target-align'
     Enable or disable automatic alignment to reduce branch penalties
     at some expense in code size.  *Note Automatic Instruction
     Alignment: Xtensa Automatic Alignment.  This optimization is
     enabled by default.  Note that the assembler will always align
     instructions like `LOOP' that have fixed alignment requirements.

`--longcalls | --no-longcalls'
     Enable or disable transformation of call instructions to allow
     calls across a greater range of addresses.  *Note Function Call
     Relaxation: Xtensa Call Relaxation.  This option should be used
     when call targets can potentially be out of range.  It may degrade
     both code size and performance, but the linker can generally
     optimize away the unnecessary overhead when a call ends up within
     range.  The default is `--no-longcalls'.

`--transform | --no-transform'
     Enable or disable all assembler transformations of Xtensa
     instructions, including both relaxation and optimization.  The
     default is `--transform'; `--no-transform' should only be used in
     the rare cases when the instructions must be exactly as specified
     in the assembly source.  Using `--no-transform' causes out of range
     instruction operands to be errors.

`--rename-section OLDNAME=NEWNAME'
     Rename the OLDNAME section to NEWNAME.  This option can be used
     multiple times to rename multiple sections.


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Syntax,  Next: Xtensa Optimizations,  Prev: Xtensa Options,  Up: Xtensa-Dependent

9.50.2 Assembler Syntax
-----------------------

Block comments are delimited by `/*' and `*/'.  End of line comments
may be introduced with either `#' or `//'.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   Instructions consist of a leading opcode or macro name followed by
whitespace and an optional comma-separated list of operands:

     OPCODE [OPERAND, ...]

   Instructions must be separated by a newline or semicolon (`;').

   FLIX instructions, which bundle multiple opcodes together in a single
instruction, are specified by enclosing the bundled opcodes inside
braces:

     {
     [FORMAT]
     OPCODE0 [OPERANDS]
     OPCODE1 [OPERANDS]
     OPCODE2 [OPERANDS]
     ...
     }

   The opcodes in a FLIX instruction are listed in the same order as the
corresponding instruction slots in the TIE format declaration.
Directives and labels are not allowed inside the braces of a FLIX
instruction.  A particular TIE format name can optionally be specified
immediately after the opening brace, but this is usually unnecessary.
The assembler will automatically search for a format that can encode the
specified opcodes, so the format name need only be specified in rare
cases where there is more than one applicable format and where it
matters which of those formats is used.  A FLIX instruction can also be
specified on a single line by separating the opcodes with semicolons:

     { [FORMAT;] OPCODE0 [OPERANDS]; OPCODE1 [OPERANDS]; OPCODE2 [OPERANDS]; ... }

   If an opcode can only be encoded in a FLIX instruction but is not
specified as part of a FLIX bundle, the assembler will choose the
smallest format where the opcode can be encoded and will fill unused
instruction slots with no-ops.

9.50.2.1 Opcode Names
.....................

See the `Xtensa Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Reference Manual'
for a complete list of opcodes and descriptions of their semantics.

   If an opcode name is prefixed with an underscore character (`_'),
`as' will not transform that instruction in any way.  The underscore
prefix disables both optimization (*note Xtensa Optimizations: Xtensa
Optimizations.) and relaxation (*note Xtensa Relaxation: Xtensa
Relaxation.) for that particular instruction.  Only use the underscore
prefix when it is essential to select the exact opcode produced by the
assembler.  Using this feature unnecessarily makes the code less
efficient by disabling assembler optimization and less flexible by
disabling relaxation.

   Note that this special handling of underscore prefixes only applies
to Xtensa opcodes, not to either built-in macros or user-defined macros.
When an underscore prefix is used with a macro (e.g., `_MOV'), it
refers to a different macro.  The assembler generally provides built-in
macros both with and without the underscore prefix, where the underscore
versions behave as if the underscore carries through to the instructions
in the macros.  For example, `_MOV' may expand to `_MOV.N'.

   The underscore prefix only applies to individual instructions, not to
series of instructions.  For example, if a series of instructions have
underscore prefixes, the assembler will not transform the individual
instructions, but it may insert other instructions between them (e.g.,
to align a `LOOP' instruction).  To prevent the assembler from
modifying a series of instructions as a whole, use the `no-transform'
directive.  *Note transform: Transform Directive.

9.50.2.2 Register Names
.......................

The assembly syntax for a register file entry is the "short" name for a
TIE register file followed by the index into that register file.  For
example, the general-purpose `AR' register file has a short name of
`a', so these registers are named `a0'...`a15'.  As a special feature,
`sp' is also supported as a synonym for `a1'.  Additional registers may
be added by processor configuration options and by designer-defined TIE
extensions.  An initial `$' character is optional in all register names.

9.50.3 Xtensa Optimizations
---------------------------

The optimizations currently supported by `as' are generation of density
instructions where appropriate and automatic branch target alignment.

* Menu:

* Density Instructions::        Using Density Instructions.
* Xtensa Automatic Alignment::  Automatic Instruction Alignment.


File: as.info,  Node: Density Instructions,  Next: Xtensa Automatic Alignment,  Up: Xtensa Optimizations

9.50.3.1 Using Density Instructions
...................................

The Xtensa instruction set has a code density option that provides
16-bit versions of some of the most commonly used opcodes.  Use of these
opcodes can significantly reduce code size.  When possible, the
assembler automatically translates instructions from the core Xtensa
instruction set into equivalent instructions from the Xtensa code
density option.  This translation can be disabled by using underscore
prefixes (*note Opcode Names: Xtensa Opcodes.), by using the
`--no-transform' command-line option (*note Command Line Options:
Xtensa Options.), or by using the `no-transform' directive (*note
transform: Transform Directive.).

   It is a good idea _not_ to use the density instructions directly.
The assembler will automatically select dense instructions where
possible.  If you later need to use an Xtensa processor without the code
density option, the same assembly code will then work without
modification.


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Automatic Alignment,  Prev: Density Instructions,  Up: Xtensa Optimizations

9.50.3.2 Automatic Instruction Alignment
........................................

The Xtensa assembler will automatically align certain instructions, both
to optimize performance and to satisfy architectural requirements.

   As an optimization to improve performance, the assembler attempts to
align branch targets so they do not cross instruction fetch boundaries.
(Xtensa processors can be configured with either 32-bit or 64-bit
instruction fetch widths.)  An instruction immediately following a call
is treated as a branch target in this context, because it will be the
target of a return from the call.  This alignment has the potential to
reduce branch penalties at some expense in code size.  This
optimization is enabled by default.  You can disable it with the
`--no-target-align' command-line option (*note Command Line Options:
Xtensa Options.).

   The target alignment optimization is done without adding instructions
that could increase the execution time of the program.  If there are
density instructions in the code preceding a target, the assembler can
change the target alignment by widening some of those instructions to
the equivalent 24-bit instructions.  Extra bytes of padding can be
inserted immediately following unconditional jump and return
instructions.  This approach is usually successful in aligning many,
but not all, branch targets.

   The `LOOP' family of instructions must be aligned such that the
first instruction in the loop body does not cross an instruction fetch
boundary (e.g., with a 32-bit fetch width, a `LOOP' instruction must be
on either a 1 or 2 mod 4 byte boundary).  The assembler knows about
this restriction and inserts the minimal number of 2 or 3 byte no-op
instructions to satisfy it.  When no-op instructions are added, any
label immediately preceding the original loop will be moved in order to
refer to the loop instruction, not the newly generated no-op
instruction.  To preserve binary compatibility across processors with
different fetch widths, the assembler conservatively assumes a 32-bit
fetch width when aligning `LOOP' instructions (except if the first
instruction in the loop is a 64-bit instruction).

   Previous versions of the assembler automatically aligned `ENTRY'
instructions to 4-byte boundaries, but that alignment is now the
programmer's responsibility.

9.50.4 Xtensa Relaxation
------------------------

When an instruction operand is outside the range allowed for that
particular instruction field, `as' can transform the code to use a
functionally-equivalent instruction or sequence of instructions.  This
process is known as "relaxation".  This is typically done for branch
instructions because the distance of the branch targets is not known
until assembly-time.  The Xtensa assembler offers branch relaxation and
also extends this concept to function calls, `MOVI' instructions and
other instructions with immediate fields.

* Menu:

* Xtensa Branch Relaxation::        Relaxation of Branches.
* Xtensa Call Relaxation::          Relaxation of Function Calls.
* Xtensa Immediate Relaxation::     Relaxation of other Immediate Fields.


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Branch Relaxation,  Next: Xtensa Call Relaxation,  Up: Xtensa Relaxation

9.50.4.1 Conditional Branch Relaxation
......................................

When the target of a branch is too far away from the branch itself,
i.e., when the offset from the branch to the target is too large to fit
in the immediate field of the branch instruction, it may be necessary to
replace the branch with a branch around a jump.  For example,

         beqz    a2, L

   may result in:

         bnez.n  a2, M
         j L
     M:

   (The `BNEZ.N' instruction would be used in this example only if the
density option is available.  Otherwise, `BNEZ' would be used.)

   This relaxation works well because the unconditional jump instruction
has a much larger offset range than the various conditional branches.
However, an error will occur if a branch target is beyond the range of a
jump instruction.  `as' cannot relax unconditional jumps.  Similarly,
an error will occur if the original input contains an unconditional
jump to a target that is out of range.

   Branch relaxation is enabled by default.  It can be disabled by using
underscore prefixes (*note Opcode Names: Xtensa Opcodes.), the
`--no-transform' command-line option (*note Command Line Options:
Xtensa Options.), or the `no-transform' directive (*note transform:
Transform Directive.).


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Call Relaxation,  Next: Xtensa Immediate Relaxation,  Prev: Xtensa Branch Relaxation,  Up: Xtensa Relaxation

9.50.4.2 Function Call Relaxation
.................................

Function calls may require relaxation because the Xtensa immediate call
instructions (`CALL0', `CALL4', `CALL8' and `CALL12') provide a
PC-relative offset of only 512 Kbytes in either direction.  For larger
programs, it may be necessary to use indirect calls (`CALLX0',
`CALLX4', `CALLX8' and `CALLX12') where the target address is specified
in a register.  The Xtensa assembler can automatically relax immediate
call instructions into indirect call instructions.  This relaxation is
done by loading the address of the called function into the callee's
return address register and then using a `CALLX' instruction.  So, for
example:

         call8 func

   might be relaxed to:

         .literal .L1, func
         l32r    a8, .L1
         callx8  a8

   Because the addresses of targets of function calls are not generally
known until link-time, the assembler must assume the worst and relax all
the calls to functions in other source files, not just those that really
will be out of range.  The linker can recognize calls that were
unnecessarily relaxed, and it will remove the overhead introduced by the
assembler for those cases where direct calls are sufficient.

   Call relaxation is disabled by default because it can have a negative
effect on both code size and performance, although the linker can
usually eliminate the unnecessary overhead.  If a program is too large
and some of the calls are out of range, function call relaxation can be
enabled using the `--longcalls' command-line option or the `longcalls'
directive (*note longcalls: Longcalls Directive.).


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Immediate Relaxation,  Prev: Xtensa Call Relaxation,  Up: Xtensa Relaxation

9.50.4.3 Other Immediate Field Relaxation
.........................................

The assembler normally performs the following other relaxations.  They
can be disabled by using underscore prefixes (*note Opcode Names:
Xtensa Opcodes.), the `--no-transform' command-line option (*note
Command Line Options: Xtensa Options.), or the `no-transform' directive
(*note transform: Transform Directive.).

   The `MOVI' machine instruction can only materialize values in the
range from -2048 to 2047.  Values outside this range are best
materialized with `L32R' instructions.  Thus:

         movi a0, 100000

   is assembled into the following machine code:

         .literal .L1, 100000
         l32r a0, .L1

   The `L8UI' machine instruction can only be used with immediate
offsets in the range from 0 to 255. The `L16SI' and `L16UI' machine
instructions can only be used with offsets from 0 to 510.  The `L32I'
machine instruction can only be used with offsets from 0 to 1020.  A
load offset outside these ranges can be materialized with an `L32R'
instruction if the destination register of the load is different than
the source address register.  For example:

         l32i a1, a0, 2040

   is translated to:

         .literal .L1, 2040
         l32r a1, .L1
         add a1, a0, a1
         l32i a1, a1, 0

If the load destination and source address register are the same, an
out-of-range offset causes an error.

   The Xtensa `ADDI' instruction only allows immediate operands in the
range from -128 to 127.  There are a number of alternate instruction
sequences for the `ADDI' operation.  First, if the immediate is 0, the
`ADDI' will be turned into a `MOV.N' instruction (or the equivalent
`OR' instruction if the code density option is not available).  If the
`ADDI' immediate is outside of the range -128 to 127, but inside the
range -32896 to 32639, an `ADDMI' instruction or `ADDMI'/`ADDI'
sequence will be used.  Finally, if the immediate is outside of this
range and a free register is available, an `L32R'/`ADD' sequence will
be used with a literal allocated from the literal pool.

   For example:

         addi    a5, a6, 0
         addi    a5, a6, 512
         addi    a5, a6, 513
         addi    a5, a6, 50000

   is assembled into the following:

         .literal .L1, 50000
         mov.n   a5, a6
         addmi   a5, a6, 0x200
         addmi   a5, a6, 0x200
         addi    a5, a5, 1
         l32r    a5, .L1
         add     a5, a6, a5

9.50.5 Directives
-----------------

The Xtensa assembler supports a region-based directive syntax:

         .begin DIRECTIVE [OPTIONS]
         ...
         .end DIRECTIVE

   All the Xtensa-specific directives that apply to a region of code use
this syntax.

   The directive applies to code between the `.begin' and the `.end'.
The state of the option after the `.end' reverts to what it was before
the `.begin'.  A nested `.begin'/`.end' region can further change the
state of the directive without having to be aware of its outer state.
For example, consider:

         .begin no-transform
     L:  add a0, a1, a2
         .begin transform
     M:  add a0, a1, a2
         .end transform
     N:  add a0, a1, a2
         .end no-transform

   The `ADD' opcodes at `L' and `N' in the outer `no-transform' region
both result in `ADD' machine instructions, but the assembler selects an
`ADD.N' instruction for the `ADD' at `M' in the inner `transform'
region.

   The advantage of this style is that it works well inside macros
which can preserve the context of their callers.

   The following directives are available:

9.50.5.1 schedule
.................

The `schedule' directive is recognized only for compatibility with
Tensilica's assembler.

         .begin [no-]schedule
         .end [no-]schedule

   This directive is ignored and has no effect on `as'.

9.50.5.2 longcalls
..................

The `longcalls' directive enables or disables function call relaxation.
*Note Function Call Relaxation: Xtensa Call Relaxation.

         .begin [no-]longcalls
         .end [no-]longcalls

   Call relaxation is disabled by default unless the `--longcalls'
command-line option is specified.  The `longcalls' directive overrides
the default determined by the command-line options.

9.50.5.3 transform
..................

This directive enables or disables all assembler transformation,
including relaxation (*note Xtensa Relaxation: Xtensa Relaxation.) and
optimization (*note Xtensa Optimizations: Xtensa Optimizations.).

         .begin [no-]transform
         .end [no-]transform

   Transformations are enabled by default unless the `--no-transform'
option is used.  The `transform' directive overrides the default
determined by the command-line options.  An underscore opcode prefix,
disabling transformation of that opcode, always takes precedence over
both directives and command-line flags.

9.50.5.4 literal
................

The `.literal' directive is used to define literal pool data, i.e.,
read-only 32-bit data accessed via `L32R' instructions.

         .literal LABEL, VALUE[, VALUE...]

   This directive is similar to the standard `.word' directive, except
that the actual location of the literal data is determined by the
assembler and linker, not by the position of the `.literal' directive.
Using this directive gives the assembler freedom to locate the literal
data in the most appropriate place and possibly to combine identical
literals.  For example, the code:

         entry sp, 40
         .literal .L1, sym
         l32r    a4, .L1

   can be used to load a pointer to the symbol `sym' into register
`a4'.  The value of `sym' will not be placed between the `ENTRY' and
`L32R' instructions; instead, the assembler puts the data in a literal
pool.

   Literal pools are placed by default in separate literal sections;
however, when using the `--text-section-literals' option (*note Command
Line Options: Xtensa Options.), the literal pools for PC-relative mode
`L32R' instructions are placed in the current section.(1) These text
section literal pools are created automatically before `ENTRY'
instructions and manually after `.literal_position' directives (*note
literal_position: Literal Position Directive.).  If there are no
preceding `ENTRY' instructions, explicit `.literal_position' directives
must be used to place the text section literal pools; otherwise, `as'
will report an error.

   When literals are placed in separate sections, the literal section
names are derived from the names of the sections where the literals are
defined.  The base literal section names are `.literal' for PC-relative
mode `L32R' instructions and `.lit4' for absolute mode `L32R'
instructions (*note absolute-literals: Absolute Literals Directive.).
These base names are used for literals defined in the default `.text'
section.  For literals defined in other sections or within the scope of
a `literal_prefix' directive (*note literal_prefix: Literal Prefix
Directive.), the following rules determine the literal section name:

  1. If the current section is a member of a section group, the literal
     section name includes the group name as a suffix to the base
     `.literal' or `.lit4' name, with a period to separate the base
     name and group name.  The literal section is also made a member of
     the group.

  2. If the current section name (or `literal_prefix' value) begins with
     "`.gnu.linkonce.KIND.'", the literal section name is formed by
     replacing "`.KIND'" with the base `.literal' or `.lit4' name.  For
     example, for literals defined in a section named
     `.gnu.linkonce.t.func', the literal section will be
     `.gnu.linkonce.literal.func' or `.gnu.linkonce.lit4.func'.

  3. If the current section name (or `literal_prefix' value) ends with
     `.text', the literal section name is formed by replacing that
     suffix with the base `.literal' or `.lit4' name.  For example, for
     literals defined in a section named `.iram0.text', the literal
     section will be `.iram0.literal' or `.iram0.lit4'.

  4. If none of the preceding conditions apply, the literal section
     name is formed by adding the base `.literal' or `.lit4' name as a
     suffix to the current section name (or `literal_prefix' value).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Literals for the `.init' and `.fini' sections are always placed
in separate sections, even when `--text-section-literals' is enabled.

9.50.5.5 literal_position
.........................

When using `--text-section-literals' to place literals inline in the
section being assembled, the `.literal_position' directive can be used
to mark a potential location for a literal pool.

         .literal_position

   The `.literal_position' directive is ignored when the
`--text-section-literals' option is not used or when `L32R'
instructions use the absolute addressing mode.

   The assembler will automatically place text section literal pools
before `ENTRY' instructions, so the `.literal_position' directive is
only needed to specify some other location for a literal pool.  You may
need to add an explicit jump instruction to skip over an inline literal
pool.

   For example, an interrupt vector does not begin with an `ENTRY'
instruction so the assembler will be unable to automatically find a good
place to put a literal pool.  Moreover, the code for the interrupt
vector must be at a specific starting address, so the literal pool
cannot come before the start of the code.  The literal pool for the
vector must be explicitly positioned in the middle of the vector (before
any uses of the literals, due to the negative offsets used by
PC-relative `L32R' instructions).  The `.literal_position' directive
can be used to do this.  In the following code, the literal for `M'
will automatically be aligned correctly and is placed after the
unconditional jump.

         .global M
     code_start:
         j continue
         .literal_position
         .align 4
     continue:
         movi    a4, M

9.50.5.6 literal_prefix
.......................

The `literal_prefix' directive allows you to override the default
literal section names, which are derived from the names of the sections
where the literals are defined.

         .begin literal_prefix [NAME]
         .end literal_prefix

   For literals defined within the delimited region, the literal section
names are derived from the NAME argument instead of the name of the
current section.  The rules used to derive the literal section names do
not change.  *Note literal: Literal Directive.  If the NAME argument is
omitted, the literal sections revert to the defaults.  This directive
has no effect when using the `--text-section-literals' option (*note
Command Line Options: Xtensa Options.).


File: as.info,  Node: Absolute Literals Directive,  Prev: Literal Prefix Directive,  Up: Xtensa Directives

9.50.5.7 absolute-literals
..........................

The `absolute-literals' and `no-absolute-literals' directives control
the absolute vs. PC-relative mode for `L32R' instructions.  These are
relevant only for Xtensa configurations that include the absolute
addressing option for `L32R' instructions.

         .begin [no-]absolute-literals
         .end [no-]absolute-literals

   These directives do not change the `L32R' mode--they only cause the
assembler to emit the appropriate kind of relocation for `L32R'
instructions and to place the literal values in the appropriate section.
To change the `L32R' mode, the program must write the `LITBASE' special
register.  It is the programmer's responsibility to keep track of the
mode and indicate to the assembler which mode is used in each region of
code.

   If the Xtensa configuration includes the absolute `L32R' addressing
option, the default is to assume absolute `L32R' addressing unless the
`--no-absolute-literals' command-line option is specified.  Otherwise,
the default is to assume PC-relative `L32R' addressing.  The
`absolute-literals' directive can then be used to override the default
determined by the command-line options.

10 Reporting Bugs
*****************

Your bug reports play an essential role in making `as' reliable.

   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
or it may not.  But in any case the principal function of a bug report
is to help the entire community by making the next version of `as' work
better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of `as'.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that enables us to fix the bug.

* Menu:

* Bug Criteria::                Have you found a bug?
* Bug Reporting::               How to report bugs


File: as.info,  Node: Bug Criteria,  Next: Bug Reporting,  Up: Reporting Bugs

10.1 Have You Found a Bug?
==========================

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If the assembler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that
     is a `as' bug.  Reliable assemblers never crash.

   * If `as' produces an error message for valid input, that is a bug.

   * If `as' does not produce an error message for invalid input, that
     is a bug.  However, you should note that your idea of "invalid
     input" might be our idea of "an extension" or "support for
     traditional practice".

   * If you are an experienced user of assemblers, your suggestions for
     improvement of `as' are welcome in any case.


File: as.info,  Node: Bug Reporting,  Prev: Bug Criteria,  Up: Reporting Bugs

10.2 How to Report Bugs
=======================

A number of companies and individuals offer support for GNU products.
If you obtained `as' from a support organization, we recommend you
contact that organization first.

   You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file `etc/SERVICE' in the GNU Emacs distribution.

   In any event, we also recommend that you send bug reports for `as'
to `https://enterprise.redhat.com/gnupro/'.

   The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
*report all the facts*.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
leave it out, state it!

   Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of a symbol you use in an example does not matter.
Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug
is a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location
where that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were
different, the contents of that location would fool the assembler into
doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a
specific, complete example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do,
and the most helpful.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix
the bug if it is new to us.  Therefore, always write your bug reports
on the assumption that the bug has not been reported previously.

   Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  This cannot help us fix a bug, so it is basically useless.  We
respond by asking for enough details to enable us to investigate.  You
might as well expedite matters by sending them to begin with.

   To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

   * The version of `as'.  `as' announces it if you start it with the
     `--version' argument.

     Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in
     looking for the bug in the current version of `as'.

   * Any patches you may have applied to the `as' source.

   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and version number.

   * What compiler (and its version) was used to compile `as'--e.g.
     "`gcc-2.7'".

   * The command arguments you gave the assembler to assemble your
     example and observe the bug.  To guarantee you will not omit
     something important, list them all.  A copy of the Makefile (or
     the output from make) is sufficient.

     If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess
     wrong and then we might not encounter the bug.

   * A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.  If the bug is
     observed when the assembler is invoked via a compiler, send the
     assembler source, not the high level language source.  Most
     compilers will produce the assembler source when run with the `-S'
     option.  If you are using `gcc', use the options `-v
     --save-temps'; this will save the assembler source in a file with
     an extension of `.s', and also show you exactly how `as' is being
     run.

   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "It gets a fatal signal."

     Of course, if the bug is that `as' gets a fatal signal, then we
     will certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we
     might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well
     not give us a chance to make a mistake.

     Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should
     still say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on,
     such as, your copy of `as' is out of sync, or you have encountered
     a bug in the C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your
     copy might crash and ours would not.  If you told us to expect a
     crash, then when ours fails to crash, we would know that the bug
     was not happening for us.  If you had not told us to expect a
     crash, then we would not be able to draw any conclusion from our
     observations.

   * If you wish to suggest changes to the `as' source, send us context
     diffs, as generated by `diff' with the `-u', `-c', or `-p' option.
     Always send diffs from the old file to the new file.  If you even
     discuss something in the `as' source, refer to it by context, not
     by line number.

     The line numbers in our development sources will not match those
     in your sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful
     information to us.

   Here are some things that are not necessary:

   * A description of the envelope of the bug.

     Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
     which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
     changes will not affect it.

     This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way
     we will find the bug is by running a single example under the
     debugger with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of
     examples.  We recommend that you save your time for something else.

     Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report _instead_
     of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
     output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
     less time, and so on.

     However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do
     this, report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you
     used.

   * A patch for the bug.

     A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not
     omit the necessary information, such as the test case, on the
     assumption that a patch is all we need.  We might see problems
     with your patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we
     might not understand it at all.

     Sometimes with a program as complicated as `as' it is very hard to
     construct an example that will make the program follow a certain
     path through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will
     not be able to construct one, so we will not be able to verify
     that the bug is fixed.

     And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why
     your patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A
     test case will help us to understand.

   * A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

     Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about
     such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

If you have contributed to GAS and your name isn't listed here, it is
not meant as a slight.  We just don't know about it.  Send mail to the
maintainer, and we'll correct the situation.  Currently the maintainer
is Nick Clifton (email address `nickc@redhat.com').

   Dean Elsner wrote the original GNU assembler for the VAX.(1)

   Jay Fenlason maintained GAS for a while, adding support for
GDB-specific debug information and the 68k series machines, most of the
preprocessing pass, and extensive changes in `messages.c',
`input-file.c', `write.c'.

   K. Richard Pixley maintained GAS for a while, adding various
enhancements and many bug fixes, including merging support for several
processors, breaking GAS up to handle multiple object file format back
ends (including heavy rewrite, testing, an integration of the coff and
b.out back ends), adding configuration including heavy testing and
verification of cross assemblers and file splits and renaming,
converted GAS to strictly ANSI C including full prototypes, added
support for m680[34]0 and cpu32, did considerable work on i960
including a COFF port (including considerable amounts of reverse
engineering), a SPARC opcode file rewrite, DECstation, rs6000, and
hp300hpux host ports, updated "know" assertions and made them work,
much other reorganization, cleanup, and lint.

   Ken Raeburn wrote the high-level BFD interface code to replace most
of the code in format-specific I/O modules.

   The original VMS support was contributed by David L. Kashtan.  Eric
Youngdale has done much work with it since.

   The Intel 80386 machine description was written by Eliot Dresselhaus.

   Minh Tran-Le at IntelliCorp contributed some AIX 386 support.

   The Motorola 88k machine description was contributed by Devon Bowen
of Buffalo University and Torbjorn Granlund of the Swedish Institute of
Computer Science.

   Keith Knowles at the Open Software Foundation wrote the original
MIPS back end (`tc-mips.c', `tc-mips.h'), and contributed Rose format
support (which hasn't been merged in yet).  Ralph Campbell worked with
the MIPS code to support a.out format.

   Support for the Zilog Z8k and Renesas H8/300 processors (tc-z8k,
tc-h8300), and IEEE 695 object file format (obj-ieee), was written by
Steve Chamberlain of Cygnus Support.  Steve also modified the COFF back
end to use BFD for some low-level operations, for use with the H8/300
and AMD 29k targets.

   John Gilmore built the AMD 29000 support, added `.include' support,
and simplified the configuration of which versions accept which
directives.  He updated the 68k machine description so that Motorola's
opcodes always produced fixed-size instructions (e.g., `jsr'), while
synthetic instructions remained shrinkable (`jbsr').  John fixed many
bugs, including true tested cross-compilation support, and one bug in
relaxation that took a week and required the proverbial one-bit fix.

   Ian Lance Taylor of Cygnus Support merged the Motorola and MIT
syntax for the 68k, completed support for some COFF targets (68k, i386
SVR3, and SCO Unix), added support for MIPS ECOFF and ELF targets,
wrote the initial RS/6000 and PowerPC assembler, and made a few other
minor patches.

   Steve Chamberlain made GAS able to generate listings.

   Hewlett-Packard contributed support for the HP9000/300.

   Jeff Law wrote GAS and BFD support for the native HPPA object format
(SOM) along with a fairly extensive HPPA testsuite (for both SOM and
ELF object formats).  This work was supported by both the Center for
Software Science at the University of Utah and Cygnus Support.

   Support for ELF format files has been worked on by Mark Eichin of
Cygnus Support (original, incomplete implementation for SPARC), Pete
Hoogenboom and Jeff Law at the University of Utah (HPPA mainly),
Michael Meissner of the Open Software Foundation (i386 mainly), and Ken
Raeburn of Cygnus Support (sparc, and some initial 64-bit support).

   Linas Vepstas added GAS support for the ESA/390 "IBM 370"
architecture.

   Richard Henderson rewrote the Alpha assembler. Klaus Kaempf wrote
GAS and BFD support for openVMS/Alpha.

   Timothy Wall, Michael Hayes, and Greg Smart contributed to the
various tic* flavors.

   David Heine, Sterling Augustine, Bob Wilson and John Ruttenberg from
Tensilica, Inc. added support for Xtensa processors.

   Several engineers at Cygnus Support have also provided many small
bug fixes and configuration enhancements.

   Jon Beniston added support for the Lattice Mico32 architecture.

   Many others have contributed large or small bugfixes and
enhancements.  If you have contributed significant work and are not
mentioned on this list, and want to be, let us know.  Some of the
history has been lost; we are not intentionally leaving anyone out.

     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
